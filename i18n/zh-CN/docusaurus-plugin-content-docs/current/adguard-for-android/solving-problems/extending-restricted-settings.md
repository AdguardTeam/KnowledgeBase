本文所述 AdGuard Android 版是在系统级上保护设备的多功能的广告拦截器。 要了解其工作原理，请[下载 AdGuard 应用程序](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

:::

In an effort to improve user privacy, Google has expanded the restriction settings in Android 15. More settings, such as _App usage access_, now require an additional permission to be enabled. Since the _[Firewall](/adguard-for-android/features/protection/firewall)_ and _[Detect Samsung Pay](/adguard-for-android/solving-problems/samsungpay-with-adguard-in-south-korea)_ features require the _App usage access_ setting to be enabled for them to work properly, you may have experienced problems using them. To resolve these issues, please follow the steps below:

:::note

AdGuard has a strict no-logging policy, which means that we do not collect your data or send it to third parties. We only ask for access to data without which the application cannot function.

:::

1. On your Android device, open the **Settings app**.
2. Tap **Apps**.
3. Tap **AdGuard**

1. Tap **More** (⁝) → _Allow restricted settings_.
