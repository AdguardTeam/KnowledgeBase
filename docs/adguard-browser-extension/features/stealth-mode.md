In Stealth Mode, you can prevent a website from seeing the search queries from you used to find it on the Internet, automatically delete third-party and website’s own cookies, etc. A [separate article](/general/stealth-mode) is devoted to all these features.

Some of the *Stealth Mode* options available in full-fledged apps are not present in the browser extensions due to technical restrictions.
