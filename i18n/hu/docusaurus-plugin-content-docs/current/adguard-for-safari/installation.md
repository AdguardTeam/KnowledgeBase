    Not all extensions are required for AdGuard for Safari to function correctly. For instance, checking the *Icon* extension enables the icon next to the search bar. However, we recommend enabling all of them.

1. To make AdGuard take effects on websites, the *Content Blockers* setting must be enabled. You can either enable for all websites or select the ones you want.

    This step is needed for iOS 9.0 and later, macOS 10.11 with Safari 10, and macOS 10.12 and later.

On macOS, click *Preference* → *Websites* → *Content Blockers*. If you want to enable AdGuard on every website, turn *When visiting other websites* to *On*.
