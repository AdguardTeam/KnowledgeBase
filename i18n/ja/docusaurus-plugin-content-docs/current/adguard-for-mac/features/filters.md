## フィルタ

![Filters](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/mac/filters.png)

Filter lists are sets of rules written using a [special syntax](/general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters). AdGuard interprets and implements these rules to block ads, trackers, and annoyances. Some filters (for example, AdGuard Base filter, Tracking Protection filter, or EasyList) are pre-installed, others can be installed additionally.

We recommend enabling the following filters:

- AdGuard ベースフィルタ
- AdGuard Tracking Protection filter and AdGuard URL Tracking filter
- AdGuard Annoyances filter
- Filters for your language

These filters are important for blocking most ads, trackers, and annoying elements. For more advanced ad blocking, you can use custom filters and user rules.

To add a filter, click `+` in the lower left corner of the list. To enable a filter, select its checkbox.

## ユーザールール

In AdGuard for Mac, user rules are located in _Filters_. To create a rule, click `+`. To enable a rule, select its checkbox. To export or import rules, open the context menu.
