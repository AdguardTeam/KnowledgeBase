In your account, you can manage your licenses, devices bound to them, personal data, email and password, view purchases and contact support.

## Manage account settings

In the *Settings* section of your AdGuard account, you can update or reset your password, change your email address, enable [two-factor authentication](../2fa), view the data stored about you by AdGuard and choose the language of your personal account and notifications.

In this section, you can also manage your email preferences:

- receive transactional emails,
- receive AdGuardâ€™s monthly newsletters,
- receive emails about AdGuard special offers and promotions,
- send read receipts to AdGuard when you open emails.

## Manage licenses

In the *Licenses* section, you can manage your licenses and the devices bound to them.

[AdGuard licenses](../../license/what-is) can be:

- bound and unbound,
- extended,
- upgraded,
- canceled. You can also update your payment details.

The devices bound to your AdGuard Ad Blocker licenses can be unbound or renamed. You can unbind unused devices by clicking the cross icon next to them.

## View purchases

The Purchase history section displays all the licenses that you have ever purchased using the email account you registered your AdGuard account with. You will also find there information about the date of purchase, order ID, payment method, and cost of the purchase.

## Contact support

The Support tab contains useful links to help you solve problems or find answers to your questions about AdGuard products. They are divided into six sections: FAQ, Send a bug repot/feature request, Report incorrect blocking, Contact support, Knowledge Base, and Discuss.
