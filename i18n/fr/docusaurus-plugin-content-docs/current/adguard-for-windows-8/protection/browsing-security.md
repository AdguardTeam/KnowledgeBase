This article describes AdGuard for Windows v8.0, a comprehensive ad blocker that protects your device at the system level. This is a beta release that is still under development. To try it, download the [beta version of AdGuard for Windows](https://agrd.io/windows_beta).

_Browsing security_ offers strong protection against harmful websites and phishing attempts.

While AdGuard for Windows is not an antivirus, it does provide essential security by warning you before visiting untrusted sites or downloading potentially dangerous files.

It won’t stop a virus that is already being downloaded, and it won’t remove existing malware. But it will block access to websites that are marked as unsafe, helping you avoid threats in the first place.

For more details about how this protection works, see our article [Phishing and malware protection](/general/browsing-security).

In the _Browsing security_ section, you can:

- turn on notifications about blocked malicious and phishing websites;
- enable sound alerts;
- allow anonymous security security-related data to be sent to AdGuard, which helps us keep our database of harmful websites up to date.
