Desktop AdGuard apps (AdGuard for Windows and AdGuard for Mac) can be used as a proxy. This means that you can route other devices' traffic through AdGuard (entirely, or traffic of specific apps/browsers).

:::note

These devices must be in the same network as the PC or Mac on which AdGuard is installed.

:::

HTTP traffic will be filtered in any case, but for AdGuard to be able to filter HTTPS traffic you need to manually install AdGuard certificate on the connected device.

## How to download and install the certificate

Depending on the operation system of your device (Windows/Mac/Android/iOS), follow one of these instructions:
