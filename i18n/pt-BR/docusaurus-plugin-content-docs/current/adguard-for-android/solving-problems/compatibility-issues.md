This article is about AdGuard for Android, a multifunctional ad blocker that protects your device at the system level. Veja como funciona ao [baixar o AdGuard](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

## VPN apps

If you are using AdGuard in the *Local VPN* filtering mode, you cannot run other VPN apps at the same time. To solve this problem, we suggest that you:

- Use [AdGuard VPN](https://adguard-vpn.com/welcome.html) — its *Integrated mode* allows two apps to operate simultaneously
- Configure your VPN app to act as an [outbound proxy](../solving-problems/outbound-proxy.md) and set up a local outbound proxy using the parameters from the third-party app
- Switch to the *Automatic proxy* mode. When you do that, AdGuard will no longer use local VPN and will reconfigure iptables instead
- Switch to the *Manual proxy* mode. To do this, go to *Settings* → *Filtering* → *Network* → *Routing mode*

:::note Compatibility

The *Automatic proxy* mode is only accessible on rooted devices. For *Manual proxy*, rooting is required on devices running on Android 10 or later.

## Private DNS

The Private DNS feature was introduced in Android Pie. Before version Q, Private DNS didn't break AdGuard DNS filtering logic and the DNS forwarding through AdGuard worked normally. But starting from version Q, the presence of Private DNS forces apps to redirect traffic through the system resolver instead of AdGuard. See Android [devs blog](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/04/dns-over-tls-support-in-android-p.html) for more details.

- To solve the problem with Private DNS, use the `$network` rule

Some device manufacturers keep Private DNS settings hidden and set 'Automatic' mode as a default one. Thus, disabling Private DNS is impossible but we can make the system think that the upstream is not valid by blocking it with a `$network` rule. For instance, if the system uses Google DNS by default, we can add rules `|8.8.4.4^$network` and `|8.8.8.8^$network` to block Google DNS.

## Unsupported browsers

### UC Browsers: UC Browser, UC Browser for x86, UC Mini, UC Browser HD

To be able to filter HTTPS traffic, AdGuard requires the user to add a certificate to the device's trusted user certificates. Unfortunately, UC-family browsers don't trust user certificates, so AdGuard cannot perform HTTPS filtering there.

- To solve this problem, move the [certificate to the system certificate store](../solving-problems/https-certificate-for-rooted.md/)

:::note Compatibility

Requires root access.

:::

### Dolphin Browser: Dolphin Browser, Dolphin Browser Express

AdGuard cannot filter its traffic when operating in the *Manual proxy* mode because this browser ignores system proxy settings.

- Use the *Local VPN* filtering mode to solve this problem

### Opera mini: Opera mini, Opera mini with Yandex

Opera mini drives traffic through a compression proxy by default and AdGuard is not able to decompress and filter it at the same time.

- There is no solution at this moment

### Puffin Browser: Puffin Browser, Puffin Browser Pro

Puffin Browser drives traffic through a compression proxy by default and AdGuard is not able to decompress and filter it at the same time.

- There is no solution at this moment
