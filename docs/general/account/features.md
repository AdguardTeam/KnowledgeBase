## Manage account settings

In the *Settings* section of your AdGuard account, you can update or reset your password, change your email address, enable one-time code log in or [two-factor authentication](../2fa), view the data stored about you by AdGuard and choose the language of your personal account and notifications.

In this section, you can also manage your email preferences:

- receive AdGuardâ€™s monthly newsletters,
- receive transactional emails,
- send read receipts to AdGuard when you open emails.

## Manage licenses

In the *Licenses* section, you can manage your licenses and the devices bound to them.

[AdGuard licenses](../../license/what-is) can be:

- bound and unbound,
- extended,
- upgraded,
- canceled.
You can also update your payment details.

The devices bound to your AdGuard Ad Blocker licenses can be unbound or renamed. To unbind unused devices, click the number of bound devices next to *Devices*, then select the right arrow -> *Remove*.

## View purchases

The *Purchase* history section displays all the licenses that you have ever purchased using the email account you registered your AdGuard account with. You will also find there information about the date of purchase, order ID, payment method, and cost of the purchase.
