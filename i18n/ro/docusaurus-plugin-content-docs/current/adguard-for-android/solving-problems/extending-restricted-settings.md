Acest articol se referă la AdGuard pentru Android, un blocant de reclame multifuncțional care vă protejează dispozitivul la nivel de sistem. Pentru a vedea cum funcționează, [descărcați aplicația AdGuard](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

:::

In an effort to improve user privacy, Google has expanded the restriction settings in Android 15. More settings, such as _App usage access_, now require an additional permission to be enabled. Since the _[Firewall](/adguard-for-android/features/protection/firewall)_ and _[Detect Samsung Pay](/adguard-for-android/solving-problems/samsungpay-with-adguard-in-south-korea)_ features require the _App usage access_ setting to be enabled for them to work properly, you may have experienced problems using them. To resolve these issues, please follow the steps below.

:::note

AdGuard has a strict no-logging policy, which means that we do not collect your data or send it to third parties. We only ask for access to data without which the application cannot function.
