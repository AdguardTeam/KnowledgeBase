在您开始翻译前，我们想要让您了解一些内容。 这样您不仅可以节省您的时间与精力，而且也能保证您翻译的句子与我们的本意更相近。

一旦您在 [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/adguard/) 上打开我们的页面，选择您需要的任何项目并选择您的语言。

即使在打开某一个软件文件夹后，您也能切换语言。

选择任何可用的软件文件夹并选择一个文件，现在您可以开始翻译了。

1. Pay attention to the glossary terms highlighted with a dotted line in a source phrase. Usually, they are special words (like brand names) that should not be translated.

    ![crowdin *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/public/Adguard/kb/en/ag-translations/terms.png)

    You can suggest your translation for translatable terms in the [AdGuard Glossary](https://crowdin.com/project/adguard-glossary) project.

1. In Crowdin, strings can have notes that make it easier to understand and translate phrases. Look for them in the "Context" field of the source string.

1. Note that source strings may also have screenshots in the Context section. They help to understand the context and convey the exact meaning.

    You can request context by clicking the "REQUEST" button.

1. In addition to suggesting new translations, you can also leave comments on strings. Use comments to let us know about mistakes in the source text or existing translations, make notes, or ask questions. If you see a comment left on your translation — try to respond to it.

    ![crowdin *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/public/Adguard/kb/en/ag-translations/comments.png)

    There's also a **Discussions** tab on the main project page that conveniently allows you to see all the comments for the specific language in this project.

    ![crowdin *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/public/Adguard/kb/en/ag-translations/discussions.png)

1. Crowdin provides a very useful and convenient tool called *Translation Memory*. With its help, you can find the previously made translations of the same words and phrases and reuse them in your translations.

    ![crowdin *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/public/Adguard/kb/en/ag-translations/tm.png)

1. Once you join a project by clicking the "Join" button, you will see the **Tasks** tab on the project page, where the tasks for specific project files get created. *Please pay attention to them: they usually have a higher priority.*

    ![crowdin *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/public/Adguard/kb/en/ag-translations/tasks.png)

1. Sometimes you can find phrases with plural forms. Please be especially attentive when translating such phrases. You can read how to translate plural forms [here](../plural-forms).

    ![crowdin *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/public/Adguard/kb/en/ag-translations/plurals.png)

    Using proper plural forms is extremely important:  please ask us in the comments if anything is unclear.

1. **Please do not write directly to the project managers and proofreaders listed in the Project info.**

    If you have questions about translations, you can always ask our proofreaders or admins through comments.

    Also, you can send an email to [translate@adguard.com](mailto:translate@adguard.com) or ask a question in the [Telegram chat](https://t.me/joinchat/UVYTLcHbr8JmOGIy). The Admins will answer you as soon as possible.
