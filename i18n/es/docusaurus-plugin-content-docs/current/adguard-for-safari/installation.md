    Not all extensions are required for AdGuard for Safari to function correctly. For instance, checking the *Icon* extension enables the icon next to the search bar. However, we recommend enabling all of them.

1. To make AdGuard take effects on websites, the *Content Blockers* setting must be enabled. You can either enable for all websites or select the ones you want.
