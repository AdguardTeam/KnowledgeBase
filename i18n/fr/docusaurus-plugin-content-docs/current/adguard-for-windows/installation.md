In case regular uninstall doesn't work for any reason, you can try to use an advanced method. First of all, you need to [download the uninstaller tool](https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/tools/Uninstall_Utility.zip) created by our developers. Extract the archive to any folder on your PC and run the **Adguard.UninstallUtility.exe** file, and allow the app to make changes to your device. Then follow the instruction below:

* Choose *Standard uninstall*, *Delete AdGuard* and click *Uninstall*.

> Follow the next steps only if after performing first two steps wasn’t enough for some reason. Usually it can be determined by seeing incorrect reinstall of AdGuard, but we strongly suggest contacting our support before using steps 3-4 of advanced uninstall instruction.

* Choose *Advanced uninstall* and click *Uninstall*.
