## How to block ads on YouTube in Safari

Unfortunately, ad blocking in the YouTube app is technically impossible, but if you watch YouTube in Safari, there is a way. We developed an action extension (available since AdGuard v4.2 for iOS) designed specifically to block ads there. After you update your app to v4.2, this extension will be installed automatically, you don't have to follow any complicated instructions. Other than ads, the extension removes the placeholder remaining after blocking on iPads. Plus, YouTube videos are played automatically again and you don't have to make an extra tap.

To activate the extension and block ads on YouTube, do the following:

1. Open youtube.com in Safari.
2. Tap the Share button.
3. Tap "Block YouTube Ads (by AdGuard)".

YouTube is now ad-free! Please note that you need to run this extension again if you reload the page.

In some cases the AdGuard extension may be not displayed. If you don't see it, try to follow the instruction again or restart your device
