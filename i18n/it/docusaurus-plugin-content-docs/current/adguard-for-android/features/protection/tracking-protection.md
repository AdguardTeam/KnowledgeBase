_Tracking protection_ (formerly known as _Stealth Mode_) prevents websites from collecting information about you, such as your IP addresses, information about your browser and operating system, screen resolution, and the page you came or were redirected from. It can also block cookies that websites use to mark your browser, save your personal settings and user preferences, or recognize you on your next visit.

   b. _Ask websites not to track you_. This feature sends the [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) and [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) signals to the websites you visit, asking web apps to disable tracking of your activity

   c. _Remove X-Client-Data header_. This feature prevents Google Chrome from sending information about its version and modifications to Google domains (including DoubleClick and Google Analytics)

2. **High**

   a. _Block trackers_. This feature uses _AdGuard Tracking Protection filter_ to protect you from online counters and web analytics tools
