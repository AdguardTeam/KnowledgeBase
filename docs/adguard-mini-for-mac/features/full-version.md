AdGuard Mini for Mac’s full version unlocks advanced features that provide extra filtering speed and power.

To activate it, you can use a regular AdGuard license, which is obtainable [on our website](https://adguard.com/license.html) or through in-app purchase. You can also use the 14-day trial to test the features beforehand.

### AdGuard Extra

AdGuard Extra is an advanced script that handles complex ads, mostly on social media and online video platforms. It also shuts down ad blocking circumvention technologies such as ad re-insertion.

### Real-time filter updates

Receive filter updates as soon as there is a new rule or a fix. This ensures that your filters are always up-to-date and no ad slips through.
