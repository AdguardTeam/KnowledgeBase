AdGuard for Windows is an easy-to-use tool that blocks annoying banners, pop-ups, video ads, and trackers. But that’s not all: it helps save bandwidth, load web pages faster, and protect your computer from undesirable and potentially malicious websites. AdGuard also shields you from phishing sites and keeps inappropriate content away from kids.

When you launch AdGuard for Windows, the main screen will appear.

At the front, you’ll find icons for quickly turning on or off *Ad blocking*, *Tracking protection*, *Annoyance blocking*, *DNS protection*, *AdGuard VPN integration*, so you can easily manage these features without diving into the settings.

To access more advanced settings, use the icons in the left menu: *Protection*, *Statistics*, *App management*, *Settings* and *Updates*. Click the arrow at the bottom to expand the menu or keep it hidden.

Each section is covered in more detail in its own article:
