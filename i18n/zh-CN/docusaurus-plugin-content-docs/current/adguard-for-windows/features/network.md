本文适用于 Windows 版的 AdGuard，它是一种多功能广告拦截器，可在系统级别保护用户的设备。 要了解其工作原理，请[下载 AdGuard 应用程序](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

「_网络_」模块专用于网络过滤，用户可以找到其他与网络相关的选项。 其中两项默认启动：「开启流量过滤」和「过滤 HTTPS」。 这都是重要的额外预防措施，可以更好地过滤网络空间。 当前大部分网站使用 HTTPS，广告亦是如此。 在许多网站上，例如 youtube.com、facebook.com 和 x.com，如果没有 HTTPS 过滤就无法删除广告。 因此除非用户有充分的理由不开启它，否则请保持开启「过滤 HTTPS」功能。

In this module you can select the checkbox _Use AdGuard as an HTTP proxy_ to use AdGuard as a regular HTTP proxy which will filter all traffic passing through it. You can also enable the _Filter websites with EV certificates_ feature. Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificates offer a stronger safety guarantee; owners of such websites have to pass a thorough and globally standardized identity verification process defined by EV guidelines. Which is the reason why some users trust websites with such certificates and prefer not to filter them.

At last, there is a section with proxy settings. There you can specify which proxy server AdGuard should use to update filters, get new versions, and so on.

### AdGuard VPN

The last section is dedicated to AdGuard VPN — an ideal tool that provides security and anonymity each time you browse the Internet. You can download it by clicking the _Download_ button or go to the AdGuard VPN website by clicking the _Homepage_ button.

How does AdGuard VPN work? Without going into technical details, we can say that VPN creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the user's computer or mobile device and a remote VPN server. In this way, data privacy is preserved, as well as the anonymity of the user, because a third-party observer sees the IP address of the VPN server and not the actual user's IP.

**What AdGuard VPN does:**

- hides your real whereabouts and helps you stay anonymous
- changes your IP address to protect your data from tracking
- encrypts your traffic to make it unreadable to third parties
- lets you configure where to use VPN and where not to (exclusions feature)
