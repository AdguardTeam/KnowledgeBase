Questo articolo riguarda AdGuard per Windows, un blocca-inserzioni multifunzionale che protegge il tuo dispositivo a livello di sistema. To see how it works, [download the AdGuard app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock).

:::note

Data and files provided in dump files are processed in accordance with [the AdGuard Privacy Policy](https://adguard.com/en/privacy.html).

:::

If you experience an issue while using AdGuard, the support team may ask you to provide a dump file. This file helps developers see what processes were running in the app at the time and identify the cause of the problem.

Follow these steps to create a dump file:

1. Press *Ctrl + Shift + Esc* to open *Task Manager*.

1. In the left sidebar, click *Details*. ![Task Manager details *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/windows/dump_file/new/task_manager_en.png)
1. Right-click the process you want to create a dump file for. In the drop-down menu, click *Create memory dump file*. ![Create dump file *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/windows/dump_file/new/create_dump_en.png)
1. Once the dump file is created, you’ll be prompted to open the folder where it’s saved. If not, you can find it in the **%tmp%** folder. ![Open file location *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/windows/dump_file/new/open_file_location_en.png)

The created dump file (`.DMP`) will have the same name as the process you selected.

:::note

AdGuard for Windows runs two processes: `Adguard.exe` and `AdguardSvc.exe`. You’ll need to create a separate dump file for each one.

Since dump files can be large, please compress them into an archive before sending them to support. Also, include the AdGuard logs to help us diagnose the issue more effectively. [Instructions for collecting logs](../adguard-logs).

## Collecting `wfpdiag.cab` file

Our support team may request a wfpdiag.cab file, along with a minidump file, to analyze system logs more thoroughly and diagnose issues. To collect the file, please follow these steps:

1. Abilita la protezione di AdGuard.

1. Click *Start* and type `cmd` to open Command Prompt

1. Right-click Command Prompt and choose *Run as administrator*

    :::note

    A wfpdiag.cab file is created in your current directory. You can change the location by typing `cd <folder_name>`.


:::

1. To start logging, enter the following command: `netsh wfp capture start`

1. Visit any website to route traffic through AdGuard and log the filtering process

1. To stop logging, enter `netsh wfp capture stop`
