## How to transfer a license to another device{#transfer}

The license key can be activated on a [limited number of devices](../what-is). If the key has already been used on the maximum allowed number of devices, you need to unbind a device from your account.

### How to unbind a device

- Click *Reset license* or *Log out* in an AdGuard app

- Remove the device from your AdGuard account:
    1. Click *AdGuard Ad Blocker* in your [AdGuard account](https://my.adguard.com/).

        ![Account Ad Blocker tab *mobile](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/general/newaccount-unbind-device-0.png)

    1. Click *Remove*.

After you have unbound the number of devices you need, you can log in to your AdGuard account on new devices. The license will be bound to them.
