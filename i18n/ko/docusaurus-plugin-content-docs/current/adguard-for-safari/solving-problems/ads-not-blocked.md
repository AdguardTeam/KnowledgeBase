In some cases, filtering may not work and ads may still be displayed even though AdGuard for Safari and the proper filters are enabled. This usually happens when something goes wrong with filter updates due to Safari bugs.

### How to fix

1. Open Safari.
2. Click _Safari_ in the left upper corner menu.
3. Click _Settings…_ → _Extensions_.
4. Clear the checkboxes for AdGuard’s 6 content-blocking extensions: _Custom_, _General_, _Other_, _Privacy_, _Security_, and _Social_.

5. Restart Safari.
6. Return to _Settings..._ → _Extensions_ and re-enable the content-blocking extensions.
7. Open AdGuard for Safari app.
8. Go to _Filters_.
9. Click _Check for updates_.
10. Do not close the AdGuard for Safari window until the filters are updated.

If this doesn’t help and ads are still not being blocked, please contact our support at support@adguard.com.

If you only have problems with a specific page or website, you can report it directly from the browser: click the AdGuard for Safari icon next to the Safari search bar, and then click _Report an issue_.
