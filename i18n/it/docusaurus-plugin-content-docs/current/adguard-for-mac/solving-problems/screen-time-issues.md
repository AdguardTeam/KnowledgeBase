If you have Content Restrictions enabled in _Screen Time_ while AdGuard is on, you may experience problems loading web pages. To check if Content Restrictions are active:

1. Go to System Settings → Screen Time → Content & Privacy → Content Restrictions

2. Check if the setting for Access to Web Content is set to _Limit Adult Websites_

If this setting is on, pages won’t load. To continue using AdGuard, disable Content & Privacy in Screen Time, and then restart the system.
