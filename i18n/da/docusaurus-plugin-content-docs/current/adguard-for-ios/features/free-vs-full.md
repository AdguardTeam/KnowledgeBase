This article is about AdGuard for iOS, a multifunctional ad blocker that protects your device at the system level. To see how it works, [download the AdGuard app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

:::note

Both AdGuard for iOS with enabled Premium and AdGuard Pro block ads on Apple smartphones and tablets. They used to differ in functionality due to certain changes made to App Store review policies in the past, but now AdGuard with a purchased subscription and AdGuard Pro are identical in their functionality.

:::

Premium AdGuard for iOS features several differences from the free version, including custom DNS settings. With these settings, you can block ads not only in Safari but in other apps too, protect your kids from adult content online, and keep your personal information safe from theft. There are other differences, too. Let’s explore them all in more detail.

1. The **DNS protection** module encrypts your DNS traffic to enhance privacy. It works across all apps and browsers, not just Safari, offering broad protection against ads and trackers.

    - **Custom DNS servers:** Choose from one of the popular DNS servers from our list or add your own custom server.

    - **Family Protection:** The Internet isn’t always kid-friendly. With AdGuard Premium, you can switch to DNS providers that block adult content and other inappropriate material to keep your children safe online.

    - **Monitoring and flexible configuration:** Recent activity log allows you to view all DNS requests sent by your device and easily manage your traffic by adding websites to blocklist or allowlist with just a tap.

2. **Advanced protection** lets you use advanced filtering rules to block more complex ads that would be left unblocked otherwise.

3. **More filter options:** When purchasing AdGuard Premium, you get access to custom filters and a security filter category, where you can choose from over 50 filters, including AdGuard’s and other popular lists.

Access these features by [purchasing a license](https://adguard.com/license.html).
