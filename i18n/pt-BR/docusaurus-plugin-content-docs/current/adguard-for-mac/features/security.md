## Phishing and malware protection

![Security](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/mac/security.png)

AdGuard has a database of fraudulent, phishing, and malicious domains. If you enable _Phishing and malware protection_, AdGuard will warn you every time you’re about to visit a dangerous website. Even if only some parts of the website are dangerous, AdGuard will check it and display a warning.

This is safe. As AdGuard checks hash prefixes, not URLs, it doesn’t know what websites you visit. [Learn more about AdGuard’s security checks](/general/browsing-security)

:::note

AdGuard is not an antivirus software. It can’t stop you from downloading suspicious files or delete existing viruses.
