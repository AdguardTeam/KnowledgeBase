If AdGuard Browser Extension for Opera fails to block ads on search websites, either automatically or manually, this indicates that the extension does not have permission to access search page results.

To grant the required permission:

![Allow access to search page results](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/browser_extension/allow-access.png)

1. Click the cube icon next to the address bar → *Manage extensions...*
1. Find AdGuard AdBlocker in the list of installed extensions and tick the box next to *Allow access to search page results*

Once this is done, ads on search websites will be blocked as expected.
