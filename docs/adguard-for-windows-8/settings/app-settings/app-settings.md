This article describes AdGuard for Windows v8.0, a comprehensive ad blocker that protects your device at the system level.

This is a beta release and still under development. If you’d like to try it, download the [beta version of AdGuard for Windows](https://agrd.io/windows_beta).

Here you can adjust the main app settings: choose between light and dark themes, set the app language, enable AdGuard to launch at system startup, and allow silent automatic updates. It’s also possible to select the update channel and specify how often AdGuard checks for filter updates.

If you wish, you can agree to send anonymized app usage data to help us improve the product.

In case of issues, you can change the logging level to create detailed logs for the support team.

In *Filter editor*, you can add your own filtering rules or import ready-to-use filters.

*Network* settings include all options related to network filtering and how AdGuard interacts with your system’s network.

[*Advanced*](/adguard-for-windows-8/settings/app-settings/advanced-settings.md) settings are intended for experienced users. They are rarely needed in everyday use and should only be changed if you know what you’re doing or if our support team asks you to.
