## AdGuardアカウントとは？

[AdGuard account](https://my.adguard.com/) is a user account that stores information about your AdGuard licenses and subscriptions, active devices, your purchase history, preferred language, and other preferences. Many AdGuard products offer an option to activate them by entering the credentials for your AdGuard account, provided it contains a valid license.

## AdGuardアカウントを登録する方法

To create an account, go to [AdGuard's official website](https://adguard.com/welcome.html) and press the *My Account* button on the top right corner of the screen. Enter your email address and create a password — your account will be registered.

> If you enter your email address while purchasing a license or receive a license accociated with your email address as a gift, an account will be created automatically. To set a password, you can follow a link from a transactional or gift letter. You can also register with the above method.

An account can also be created directly in an AdGuard app. Press the *Log in* or *Activate* button (it can be found in the *License* section or on a separate screen), enter your email and create a password.

After the account is created, activate it by following the link in the activation email.
