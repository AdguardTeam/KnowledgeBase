### Assistant {#assistant}

![Safari Assistant \*mobile\_border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/public/Adguard/kb/iOS/features/assistant_en.jpeg)

Assistant is a tool that helps you manage filtering in Safari right from the browser without switching back to the app.

To see it, do the following: open Safari and tap the arrow-in-a-box symbol. Then scroll down to AdGuard/AdGuard Pro (depending on the app you use) and tap it to fetch a window with several options:

- **Enable on this page.**
  Turn the switch off to add the current domain to the Allowlist.
- **Block an element on this page.**
  Tap it to enter the 'Element blocking' mode: choose any element on the page, adjust the size by tapping '+' or '–', preview if necessary and then tap the checkmark icon to confirm. The selected element will be hidden from the page and a corresponding rule will be added to User rules. Remove or disable it to revert the change.
- **Report an issue on this page.**
  Opens a web reporting tool that will help you send a report to our support team in just a few taps. Use it if you noticed a missed ad or an incorrect blocking on the page.

:::tip

On iOS 15 devices, the Assistant features are available through [AdGuard Safari Web Extension](/adguard-for-ios/web-extension), which enhances the capabilities of AdGuard for iOS and allows you to take advantage of iOS 15. With this web extension, AdGuard can apply advanced filter rules and, as a result, block more ads.
