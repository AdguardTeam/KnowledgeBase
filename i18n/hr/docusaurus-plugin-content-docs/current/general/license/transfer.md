## How to transfer a license to another device{#transfer}

The license key can be activated on a [limited number of devices](../what-is#devices). If the key has already been used on the maximum allowed number of devices, you need to unbind a device from your account.

### How to unbind a device

There are three ways to do it:

- by clicking the *Reset license* button (can be done only in AdGuard desktop apps)
- by logging out of your account in an AdGuard product
- by removing the device in your AdGuard account:
    1. Click **AdGuard Ad Blocker** in your [AdGuard account](https://my.adguard.com/)

        ![Account Ad Blocker tab *mobile](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/general/newaccount-unbind-device-0.png)

    1. In the license card, click the device you want to unbind

        ![Select device *mobile](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/general/newaccount-unbind-device-1.png)

    1. Click **Remove**

        ![Click Remove *mobile](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/general/newaccount-unbind-device-2.png)

After you have unbound the number of devices you need, you can log in to your AdGuard account on new devices. The license will be bound to them.
