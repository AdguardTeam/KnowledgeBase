After you select an app (**let's take Chrome as an example**), you'll get a few options of what you can do.

You'll be taken to the AdGuard app, where you'll see detailed statistics about Chrome:

- Number of ads and trackers blocked in Chrome
- Data saved by blocking Chrome's ad or tracking requests
- Companies that Chrome sends requests to

#### App management

You'll be taken to the AdGuard app screen where you can disable AdGuard protection for the app.

#### Firewall settings

You'll be taken to the AdGuard screen where you can change Firewall settings for the app, meaning you can manage the app's Internet access.

### Websites tab

![Assistant websites tab \*mobile](https://cdn.adtidy.org/blog/new/74y9rAssistant-websites.jpg)

Select a website (**we use google.com here purely as an example**) and you'll see few options of what you can do.

![Assistant google.com info \*mobile](https://cdn.adtidy.org/blog/new/tht0tgoogle-com-assistant.jpg)

#### Add to allowlist

Tapping this option will instantly add `google.com` to allowlist, and AdGuard will no longer filter it (meaning ads and trackers won't be blocked for the website).

#### Recent activity

You'll be taken to the AdGuard app, where you'll see detailed info on the last 10K requests to google.com.

![website recent activity \*mobile\_border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/blog/new/xq7f3assistant-website-recent-activity.png)

#### Website statistics

You'll be taken to the AdGuard app, where you'll see detailed statistics about google.com:

- Number of blocked ad and tracking requests to google.com
- Data saved by blocking ad and tracking requests to google.com
- Apps that send requests to google.com
