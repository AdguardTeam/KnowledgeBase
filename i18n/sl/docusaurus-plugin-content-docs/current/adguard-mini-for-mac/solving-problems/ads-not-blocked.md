In some cases, filtering may not work and ads may still be displayed even though AdGuard Mini for Mac and the proper filters are enabled. This usually happens when something goes wrong with filter updates due to Safari bugs.

### How to fix

1. Open Safari.
2. Click _Safari_ in the left upper corner menu.
3. Click _Settings…_ → _Extensions_.
4. Clear the checkboxes for AdGuard Mini’s extensions: _Custom_, _General_, _Other_, _Privacy_, _Security_, _Social_, and _AdGuard for Safari_.

6. Return to Safari → _Settings..._ → _Extensions_ and re-enable the AdGuard extensions.
7. Open AdGuard Mini’s menu.
8. Click _Check for updates_ icon.

9. Do not close the AdGuard Mini window until the filters are updated.

If this doesn’t help and ads are still not being blocked, please contact our support at [support@adguard.com](mailto:support@adguard.com).

If you only have problems with a specific page or website, you can report it directly from the browser: click the AdGuard Mini icon next to the Safari search bar and then click _Report an issue_.
