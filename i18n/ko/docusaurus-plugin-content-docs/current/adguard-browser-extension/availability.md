브라우저만 보호하는 AdGuard 브라우저 확장 프로그램에 관한 문서입니다. To protect your entire device, [download the AdGuard app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

[AdGuard Browser Extension](https://adguard.com/adguard-browser-extension/overview.html) is a free extension that works in five popular browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, and Yandex Browser. 브라우저의 부가 기능 스토어나 공식 웹사이트에서 쉽게 찾을 수 있습니다.

Browser extensions include basic ad-blocking features but cannot be compared with full-featured desktop programs, such as [AdGuard for Windows](/adguard-for-windows/features/home-screen) and [AdGuard for Mac](/adguard-for-mac/features/main).

Safari용 독립 실행형 확장 프로그램이 있습니다. Since the release of [Safari 13](https://adguard.com/en/blog/adguard-safari-1-5.html), most of the ad-blocking extensions have experienced huge issues and many of them stopped functioning. We had to develop a [separate extension for Safari](/adguard-for-safari/features/general) that has some differences in comparison with the extension described in this article.

**Do not forget that the functionality of each extension is strictly limited by the browser’s capabilities.** So if you want to get full-fledged protection, consider installing a standalone program for your computer. There's [a reason why](adguard-browser-extension/comparison-standalone).
