*Advanced blocking* is optional, but when enabled it unlocks stronger filtering: for example, it lets us apply extended rules to block tough cases such as some YouTube ads. You decide whether to grant Safari the extra permissions and whether you want that extra power.

Here you can turn on the *AdGuard Extra* userscript — if there’s a website where ads just won’t go, like Facebook or YouTube.

:::note

*AdGuard Extra* is a feature of the [full version](adguard-mini-for-mac/features/full-version.md).
