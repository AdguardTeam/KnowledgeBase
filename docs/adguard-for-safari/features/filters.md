A filter is a list of rules written in a special syntax. Following these rules, content blockers can filter web traffic: block ads or requests to malicious websites.

Filters are combined into eight thematic categories: *Ad Blocking, Privacy, Social widgets, Annoyances, Security, Language-specific filters, Custom, and Other filters*.

Read more about [AdGuard filters](/general/ad-filtering/adguard-filters) or [ad filtering in general](/general/ad-filtering/how-ad-blocking-works).

In the Filters tab, you can enable the whole category or separate filters. Changes in the Filters tab are reflected in the Content Blockers section (located in the General tab).
