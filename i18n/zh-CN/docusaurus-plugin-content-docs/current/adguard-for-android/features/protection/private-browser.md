本文所述 AdGuard Android 版是在系统级上保护设备的多功能的广告拦截器。 要了解其工作原理，请[下载 AdGuard 应用程序](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

:::

In v4.7, AdGuard for Android introduced an in-app private browser. You can access it from the main screen by tapping the _Private browser_ button or from the _Protection_ tab, where you can find some customization options.

Here's what you can set up:

- To set a default search engine, tap _Default search engine_ and choose between the available options: DuckDuckGo (default), Google, Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, or Yandex
- To create a browser shortcut, tap _Create browser widget_ and follow the on-screen instructions
- To get suggestions from your search engine instead of typing the entire query, toggle the _Search suggestions_ option

:::note

The private browser is still in the early stages of development and has some limitations. For now, we recommend using it as a supplement to your browser’s Incognito mode, rather than as a replacement.
