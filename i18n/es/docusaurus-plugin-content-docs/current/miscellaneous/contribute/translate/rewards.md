Como cualquier esfuerzo honesto y bien realizado debe ser recompensado, los traductores activos en Crowdin pueden solicitar una clave de licencia gratuita de AdGuard y una suscripción VPN.

## How our reward system works

- For your first one-year Ad Blocker license, you need to translate **1,000 words**.
- For your second license, you’ll need an **additional 1,500 words** (a total of 2,500 words).
- All subsequent licenses require an **additional 2,500** words per license.

### For AdGuard VPN licenses

- The first one-year VPN subscription requires translating **3,000 words**.
- All subsequent subscriptions or renewals require an **additional 3,000 words** per subscription.

:::note Limitations

As a reward for contributing, we offer licenses and subscriptions valid for a maximum of 5 years. In the case of Ad Blocker, we offer licenses that cover up to 5 devices. We do not offer lifetime licenses.

## How to request your license

Just send an email to our translators team at [translate@adguard.com](mailto:translate@adguard.com) with the following information:

- Your Crowdin username
- The projects you contributed to (Websites, Applications, Knowledge Base, etc.)
- The email address to which you want to link your license
- Your translation statistics (a screenshot or total word count) and the type of license you want

**Email template:**

> Hi AdGuard team!
> 
> I’ve translated more than 5,000 words in AdGuard for Android in (*your language*) — you can find my stats attached. I would like to request an AdGuard VPN license and an Ad Blocker license for that. My email is (*your email address*). My Crowdin username is (*your username*).

## How to check your translation progress

Open a project you have been working on, click the *Reports* tab, select *My Contribution*, scroll down, select a date range, and generate a report. It will look something like this.

You can add up the number of words translated across different projects to qualify for a license.

## Cómo convertirte en corrector

Our most active translators may be considered for proofreader status in the future. To become a proofreader, you’ll need to deliver consistently high quality translations over a period of several months.

Please note that proofreaders do not receive extra licenses or benefits beyond helping more people access AdGuard products in their language. If you’re interested in becoming one of our proofreaders, please contact us at [translate@adguard.com](mailto:translate@adguard.com).

## Gifts for active contributors

To the best contributors, every year we send gifts with the AdGuard merch and give a shout out on our [blog](https://adguard.com/en/blog/best-contributors-2023.html).
