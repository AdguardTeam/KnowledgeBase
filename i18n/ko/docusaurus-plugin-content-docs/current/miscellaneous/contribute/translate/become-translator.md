### 교정자가 되는 방법 {#proofreaders}

We have proofreaders (previously known as moderators) for each language. And every active translator has an option to become one.

So, what are proofreaders responsible for?

**Proofreaders:**

- 고품질 번역을 승인하고 잘못된 번역을 비승인합니다.

- 번역의 관련성을 관리합니다.

- 해당 언어로 번역과 관련된 댓글에 응답합니다.

Every year, the best proofreaders receive gifts from AdGuard. Active translators do not go unrewarded either. Read more about our [reward system](../rewards).
