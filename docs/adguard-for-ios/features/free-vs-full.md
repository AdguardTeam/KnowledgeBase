This article is about AdGuard for iOS, a multifunctional ad blocker that protects your device at the system level. To see how it works, [download the AdGuard app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

:::

In addition to the excellent ad-blocking capabilities in Safari that regular AdGuard users are already familiar with, the premium version and AdGuard Pro take things further by offering custom DNS settings. They allow you to block ads not only in Safari, but in any apps, protect your kids from adult content online, and safeguard your personal data from theft. Let’s explore each of these features in more detail.

:::note

Both AdGuard and AdGuard Pro block ads on smartphones and tablets by Apple. They used to differ in functionality due to the changing App Store review guidelines, but now regular AdGuard with purchased premium subscription and AdGuard Pro are identical.

:::

- The **DNS protection** module encrypts your DNS traffic to enhance privacy. It works across all apps and browsers, not just Safari, offering broad protection against ads and trackers.

- With **Advanced protection**, you can use advanced filtering rules to block complex ads. Without this feature, such rules are ignored and not applied.

- **Family Protection:** The internet isn’t always kid-friendly. With AdGuard Pro, you can switch to DNS providers that block adult content and other inappropriate material to keep your children safe online.

- **Flexible configuration:** If you want to block or allow a website, the DNS request log lets you easily manage your blocklist or allowlist with just a tap.

- **DNS servers:** Choose from one of the popular DNS servers from our list or add your own custom server.

- **More filter options:** When purchasing AdGuard Pro, you get access to custom filters and a security filter category, where you can choose from over 50 filters, including AdGuard’s and other popular lists.

Access these features by [purchasing a license](https://adguard.com/license.html).
