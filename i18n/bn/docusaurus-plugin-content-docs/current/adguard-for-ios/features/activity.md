This article is about AdGuard for iOS, a multifunctional ad blocker that protects your device at the system level. To see how it works, [download the AdGuard app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

:::

_Activity_ screen is the 'information hub' of AdGuard's DNS protection suite. You can quickswitch to it by tapping the third icon in the bottom bar. N.b. this screen is only seen when DNS protection is enabled.

This is where AdGuard displays statistics about the device's DNS requests, such as total number, number of blocked requests and data saved by blocking them. AdGuard can display the statistics for a day, a week, a month or in total.

Below is the _Recent activity_ feed. AdGuard stores the last 1500 DNS requests that have originated on your device and shows their attributes such as protocol type and target domain.

:::note

AdGuard does not send this information anywhere. It is 100% local and does not leave your device.

Tap any request to view more details. There will also be buttons to add the request to Blocklist/Allowlist in one tap.

Above the activity feed, there are _Most active_ and _Most blocked_ companies. Tap each to see data based on the last 1500 requests.
