The Tracking protection module can be accessed by tapping the _Protection_ tab (second-left icon at the bottom of the screen) and then selecting _Annoyance blocking_.

This feature is based on AdGuard's annoyance filters and allows you to block popups, online assistant windows, cookie notifications, prompts to download mobile apps, and similar annoyances that aren't ads but still detract from your online experience.
