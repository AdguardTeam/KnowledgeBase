## Comment ça marche

AdGuard Browser Assistant is a browser extension. It allows you to quickly manage the AdGuard app:

- Enable or disable protection for a specific website (a toggle under the website name)
- Pause protection for 30 seconds
- Disable protection (the pause icon in the upper right corner)
- Manually block an ad
- Open the filtering log
- Report incorrect blocking
- Open AdGuard settings
- View website certificate and manage HTTPS filtering (the lock icon next to the website name)

## Comment installer

When you install AdGuard for Mac, you will be prompted to install Browser Assistant for your default browser. If you skip this step, you can install it later.

**From settings**:

1. Open the AdGuard menu.
2. Click the gear icon and select _Preferences_.
3. Switch to the _Assistant_ tab.
4. Click _Get the Extension_ next to your default browser.
5. Install Assistant from your browser’s extension store.

2. Under your browser name, select _Install_.
3. Install Assistant from your browser’s extension store.

:::note

In rare cases, a browser may be incompatible with Assistant. To manage AdGuard from your browser, you can install the legacy Assistant instead.

:::

## Legacy Assistant

The legacy Assistant is the previous version of AdGuard Browser Assistant. It’s a userscript that doesn’t require additional installation. While the legacy Assistant does its job well, it has several drawbacks:

- It has fewer features than the extension version.
- You have to wait for the userscript to be inserted into a webpage — sometimes it doesn’t load immediately.
- You can’t hide the Assistant icon on the page.

We recommend that you use the legacy Assistant only if the new Assistant is not available.
