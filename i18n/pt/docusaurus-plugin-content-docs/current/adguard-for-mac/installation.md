    * /Library/Logs/com.adguard.mac.adguard/com.adguard.mac.adguard.adguard-pac.daemon.log (file)
    * /Library/Logs/com.adguard.mac.adguard/com.adguard.mac.adguard.adguard-tun-helper.daemon.log (file)

**To do so**, open the Terminal app, then enter and execute the following commands:

`sudo rm -R "/Library/Application Support/AdGuard Software/com.adguard.mac.adguard"` `rm -R "$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.adguard.mac.adguard"` `rm $HOME/Library/Preferences/com.adguard.mac.adguard.plist` `rm -R "$HOME/Library/Group Containers/TC3Q7MAJXF.com.adguard.mac"` `find "$HOME/Library/Application Support" -name "com.adguard.browser_extension_host.nm.json" -delete` `sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.adguard.mac.adguard.adguard-pac.daemon.plist` `sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.adguard.mac.adguard.adguard-tun-helper.daemon.plist` `sudo rm /Library/Logs/com.adguard.mac.adguard/com.adguard.mac.adguard.adguard-pac.daemon.log` `sudo rm /Library/Logs/com.adguard.mac.adguard/com.adguard.mac.adguard.adguard-tun-helper.daemon.log`
