One of the most popular questions users ask us is: 'Is it possible to block ads in YouTube on Android?'. Due to the technical restrictions of the Android OS, there is no way to *completely* remove ads from the YouTube app. But we've found an alternative that brings you to it as close as possible, while getting around the Android-imposed restrictions.

That's it! A new window with the video will open where you'll be able to watch it without being interrupted by ads.

## Watch YouTube in a browser

Alternatively, you can also watch YouTube in a browser and there will be no ads if you have AdGuard installed and enabled.
