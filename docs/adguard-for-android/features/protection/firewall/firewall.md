The Firewall module can be accessed by tapping the *Protection* tab (second-left icon at the bottom of the screen) and then selecting *Firewall*.

This feature helps manage Internet access for specific apps installed on your device and for the device in general.

#### Global firewall rules

This section allows you to control Internet access for the entire device.

These rules apply to all apps on your device unless you've set custom rules for them.

#### Custom firewall rules

In this section, you can control Internet access for specific apps — restrict permissions for those that you don’t find trustworthy, or, on the contrary, unblock the ones you want to circumvent the global firewall rules.

1. Open *Custom firewall rules*. Under *Apps with custom rules*, tap *Add app*.

1. If you need to block a specific type of connection, toggle the switch to the left. If you want to allow it, leave the switch enabled. **Custom rules override global ones**: any changes you make in *Global firewall rules* will not affect this app.

To delete a rule or app from *Custom rules*, swipe it to the left.
