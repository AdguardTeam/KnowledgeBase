This article is about AdGuard for iOS, a multifunctional ad blocker that protects your device at the system level. To see how it works, [download the AdGuard app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

:::

In iOS 15, Apple added support for Safari Web Extensions and we added a new _Advanced protection_ module to AdGuard for iOS. It allows AdGuard to apply advanced filtering rules, such as [CSS rules](/general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters#cosmetic-css-rules), [Extended CSS selectors](/general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters#extended-css-selectors), and [scriptlets](/general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters#scriptlets) to deal with even the complex ads, such as YouTube ads.

### How to enable

To enable _Advanced protection_, open the _Protection_ tab by tapping the second left icon at the bottom of the screen, select the _Advanced protection_ module, activate the feature by toggling the switch slider, and follow the on-screen instructions.

:::note

The _Advanced protection_ only works on iOS 15 and later versions. If you are using earlier versions of iOS, you will see the _YouTube ad blocking_ module in the app instead of the _Advanced protection_.
