This article is about AdGuard for iOS, a multifunctional ad blocker that protects your device at the system level. To see how it works, [download the AdGuard app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

:::

If you look for AdGuard in the App Store, you'll find two apps â€” [AdGuard](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1047223162) and [AdGuard Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1126386264). These apps are designed to block ads and trackers in Safari, other browsers, and apps, and to manage DNS protection.

Don't be misled by their names, both apps block ads on smartphones and tablets by Apple. They used to differ in functionality due to the changing App Store review guidelines, but now these two apps are [basically the same](https://adguard.com/en/blog/updating-adguard-pro-for-ios.html).

If you have purchased AdGuard premium, there is no need to get AdGuard Pro, and vice versa.
