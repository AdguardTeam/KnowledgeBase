In *Settings* → *Filters*, you can enable separate filters or whole categories of filters.

Filters are the backbone of ad blocking and basically it’s what keeps the Internet clean. A filter is a list of rules written in a special syntax. Following these rules, content blockers can filter web traffic: block ads or requests to malicious websites.

Filters are combined into eight thematic categories: *Ad Blocking, Privacy, Social widgets, Annoyances, Security, Language-specific filters, Custom,* and *Other filters*.

Changes in *Filters* are also reflected in *Settings* → *Safari extensions*.

## Custom filters

To add a custom filter, go to *Settings* → *Filters* → *Custom filters* and enter a URL or a local file path in the relevant field.

You can find a lot of filters at [filterlists.com](https://filterlists.com/).
