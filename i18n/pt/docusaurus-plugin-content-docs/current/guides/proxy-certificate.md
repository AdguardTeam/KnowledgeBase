Desktop AdGuard apps (AdGuard for Windows and AdGuard for Mac) can be used as a proxy. This means that you can route other devices' traffic through AdGuard (entirely, or traffic of specific apps/browsers).

> Note that these devices must be in the same network as the PC or Mac on which AdGuard is installed.

HTTP traffic will be filtered in any case, but for AdGuard to be able to filter HTTPS traffic you need to manually install AdGuard certificate on the connected device.
