While Safari content blocking and DNS protection are indisputably two major modules of AdGuard/AdGuard Pro, there are some other minor features that don't fall into either of them directly but still can be useful and are worth knowing about.

### **Dark theme**

Residing right at the top of **Settings** → **General** screen, this setting allows you to switch between dark and light themes.

### **Widgets**

AdGuard supports widgets that provide quick access to Safari content blocking and DNS protection switches, and also show global requests stats.

### **Auto-update over Wi-Fi only**

If this setting is enabled, AdGuard will use only Wi-Fi for background filter updates.

### **Invert the Allowlist**

An alternative mode for Safari filtering, it unblocks ads everywhere except for the specified websites from the list. Disabled by default.

### **Advanced mode**

**Advanced mode** unlocks **Advanced settings**. We don't recommend messing with those, unless you know what you're doing or you have consulted with technical support first.

### **Reset statistics**

Clears all statistical data, such as number of requests, etc.

### **Reset settings**

This option will reset all your settings.

### **Support**

Use this option to contact support, report a missed ad (although we advise to use the Assistant or AdGuard's Safari Web extension for your own convenience), export logs or to make a feature request.

### **About**

Contains the current version of the app and an assortment of rarely needed options and links.
