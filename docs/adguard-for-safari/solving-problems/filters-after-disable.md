If filtering doesn’t stop when AdGuard for Safari is disabled, it may be because content blockers take too long to update.

## How to fix

 1. Open Safari.
 2. Click *Safari* in the left upper corner menu.
 3. Click *Settings…* → *Extensions*.
 4. Clear the checkboxes for AdGuard’s 6 content-blocking extensions: *Custom*, *General*, *Other*, *Privacy*, *Security*, *Social*, and 2 others: *AdGuard for Safari* and *AdGuard Assistant*.

 5. Restart Safari.
 6. Return to *Settings...* → *Extensions* and re-enable the content-blocking extensions.

Now everything should work as intended: filtering is on when AdGuard for Safari is enabled, and filtering is off when it is disabled.
