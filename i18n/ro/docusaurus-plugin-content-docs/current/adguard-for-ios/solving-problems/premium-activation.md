Acest articol se referă la AdGuard pentru iOS, un blocant de reclame multifuncțional care vă protejează dispozitivul la nivel de sistem. To see how it works, [download the AdGuard app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock).

There are two ways to activate Premium features in the AdGuard for iOS app:

1. **Purchase a subscription.** Just tap the **Get Premium** plaque anywhere in the app and follow the on-screen instructions. Enter your Apple Account password and confirm the purchase. You can choose a monthly, yearly, or lifetime subscription.

2. **Use an AdGuard license.** You can buy one on the [AdGuard website](https://adguard.com/license.html). To activate it, open your AdGuard app, tap *Settings → License → Log in* and enter the same email address you used for purchase or your license key. If you have a valid license key in your account, the app will detect it automatically and activate Premium.

Alternatively, to activate Premium features, you can enter a valid license key in the email field and leave the password field blank.

AdGuard Pro for iOS is our other iOS app. It can only be purchased from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/adguard-pro-adblock-privacy/id1126386264).
