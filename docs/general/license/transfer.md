## How to transfer a license to another device{#transfer}

The license key can be activated on a [limited number of devices](../what-is). If the key has already been used on the maximum allowed number of devices, you need to unbind a device from your account.

As an alternative, you can remove the device in your AdGuard account:

    1. Log in to your [AdGuard account](https://adguardaccount.com/).
    
    1. Open *AdGuard Ad Blocker* tab.
