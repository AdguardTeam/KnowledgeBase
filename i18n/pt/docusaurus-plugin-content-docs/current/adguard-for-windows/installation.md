## How to uninstall AdGuard for Windows {#uninstall}

If you need to uninstall or reinstall AdGuard, do the following:

- For Microsoft Windows 10 & 11: Open the *Start Menu* by clicking *Start*, then select *Settings*. In the window that opens, click  *Apps* → *Installed apps*. Select *AdGuard* from the list of your installed apps, click the three-dot menu, and select *Uninstall*.

   ![Windows 10 & 11 uninstallation *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/windows/installation/installation_new/win11_uninstall_adguard.png)

- For Microsoft Windows 8: Right-click the *empty space* in the lower left corner of the task bar and select *Control Panel*. Click *Uninstall a program* in the *Programs* section, then select *AdGuard* from the list of installed apps and press the *Uninstall* button located right above the list. Confirm the action by clicking *Uninstall AdGuard* in the window that opens.

- For Microsoft Windows 8.1: Right-click the *Start button* and select *Control Panel*. Click *Uninstall a program* in the *Programs* section, then select *AdGuard* from the list of installed apps and press the *Uninstall* button located right above the list. Confirm the action by clicking *Uninstall AdGuard* in the window that opens.

Click *Uninstall a program* in the *Programs* section, then select *AdGuard* from the list of installed apps and press the *Uninstall* button located right above the list. Confirm the action by clicking *Uninstall AdGuard* in the window that opens.

### Advanced method {#advanced}

In case regular uninstall doesn't work for any reason, you can try to use an advanced method. First of all, you need to [download the uninstaller tool](https://static.adtidy.org/windows/uninstaller/uninstal_utility.zip) created by our developers. Extract the archive to any folder on your PC and run the **Adguard.UninstallUtility.exe** file, and allow the app to make changes to your device. Then follow the instruction below:

- Select *AdGuard Ad Blocker* and *Standard* uninstall type, then click *Uninstall*.

   ![Standard uninstall *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/windows/installation/ab_standard.jpg)

- Click *OK* once the warning window pops up:

   ![Standard uninstall warning *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/windows/installation/ab_extended_warning.jpg)

- Wait until uninstall is finished — there will be a phrase **Uninstall complete** and a prompt to restart your computer:

   ![Uninstall finished *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/windows/installation/ab_standard_complete.jpg)

:::caution

Follow the next steps only if performing the first two steps wasn’t enough for some reason. We strongly suggest contacting our support before using steps 3-4 of advanced uninstall instruction.

:::

- Select *AdGuard Ad Blocker* and *Extended* uninstall type, then click *Uninstall*. Click *Yes, continue* in the window prompt.

   ![Extended uninstall *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/windows/installation/ab_extended.jpg)

- Click *OK* once the warning window pops up:

   ![Extended uninstall warning *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/windows/installation/ab_extended_warning.jpg)

- Wait until uninstall is finished — there will be a phrase **Uninstall complete** and a prompt to restart your computer:

   ![Extended uninstall finished *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/windows/installation/ab_extended_complete.jpg)

AdGuard is successfully uninstalled!

#### Running the uninstaller in console mode

Besides running the advanced uninstaller in its user-interactive mode, you can also use command-line arguments to uninstall AdGuard for Windows. To do this, follow the instructions below:

1. Open Command Prompt by typing *cmd* from the Start menu.
2. Use `/console` to run the uninstaller in console mode, without the interactive UI. All the command-line parameters below will be ignored if the `/console` mode is not activated.
3. Use `/adblocker` to uninstall AdGuard for Windows. It should look like this:

   `Adguard.UninstallUtility.exe /console /adblocker`

4. You can also use `/advanced` to force the uninstaller to run in *Advanced mode* and `/settings` to force the uninstaller to remove user settings along with the application.

:::note

The use of the parameters `/console` and `/adblocker` is necessary for a successful uninstall. The parameters `/advanced` and `/settings` are optional.
