Many websites collect details about their visitors: IP addresses, browser and OS information, screen resolution, even the page you came from. Cookies can also be used to mark your browser, remember your settings, or identify you on your next visit. Tracking protection prevents such systems from gathering your personal data. More about you can learn in a [designated article about Tracking protection in AdGuard](https://adguard.com/kb/general/stealth-mode/)

![Tracking protection *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/windows/version_8/protection/tracking_protection.png)

If you don’t want to spend time adjusting filters manually, you can simply pick one of the ready-made protection levels:

- *Standard*: enabled by default and provides reliable protection for everyday browsing.
- *High*: removes tracking parameters from page URLs and blocks third-party cookies. You may have to re-log in to some websites or face other cookie-related issues.
- *Extreme*: limits cookie lifetime of third-party cookies and blocks certain browser APIs. Some websites may not work correctly.

For maximum flexibility, select *Custom* and adjust everything manually. The settings there are divided into five categories:

[General settings](#general-settings)

[Tracking methods](#tracking-methods)

[Browser API](#browser-api)

[Windows tracking](#windows-tracking)

[Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous)

## General settings

![General settings *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/windows/version_8/protection/general_settings.png)

### Block trackers

Blocks trackers and web analytics using AdGuard Tracking Protection filter.

### Remove tracking parameters from URLs

Strips tracking parameters such as utm_* and fb_ref from pages’ URLs using the AdGuard URL Tracking filter.

### Hide your search queries

Hides queries for websites visited from a search engine. When you get directed to a website from Google, Yahoo, or any other search engine, this option hides the search query that you used to find that website.

### Ask websites not to track you

Sends the [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#gpc-spec) and [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) signals to the websites you visit.

## Tracking methods

![Tracking methods *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/windows/version_8/protection/tracking_methods.png)

### Self-destruction of third-party cookies

Websites use cookies to store your preferences — for example, the language you chose, your location, or the items in your shopping cart. When you return, the browser sends these cookies back so the site can “remember” you.

Third-party cookies work the same way, but they are created by domains other than the one you’re visiting. For instance, cnn.com may include a Facebook “Like” widget that sets a cookie later read by Facebook. Advertisers often use such cookies to track which other sites you visit.

With this option, you can set a time limit (in minutes) after which all third-party cookies will be deleted. If you set the timer to 0, such cookies will be blocked completely.

![Time-to-live *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/windows/version_8/protection/third-party_cookies.png)

:::caution

Keep in mind that this setting removes all third-party cookies, including those used for logins via social networks or other external services. This means you may need to log in again from time to time or deal with other cookie-related issues. If you only want to block tracking cookies, use the [*AdGuard Tracking Protection filter*](/general/ad-filtering/filter-policy/#tracking-protection-filter).

### Self-destruction of first-party cookies (not recommended)

This option deletes cookies set by the website you are currently visiting after a selected period of time (in minutes). When the timer runs out, all such cookies are removed. Set the timer to 0 to block them completely.

:::caution

We do not recommend enabling this option as it may severely interfere with the work of certain websites.

### Block ETag and If-None-Match headers

Removes the ETag and If-None-Match headers from requests and responses to prevent websites from using them for tracking.

When a browser addresses a page, the server assigns it an ETag — a unique identifier used to cache the page’s contents. On subsequent visits, the browser sends the same ETag back to the server. This allows the server to recognize the visitor. As long as the cached files remain, the ETag is transmitted with every request. If the page also contains embedded elements from other servers, such as images or iframes, those servers can use ETags to track your activity without your knowledge.

### Block third-party Authorization header

Disables cached authorization data that can be used for tracking purposes. May interfere with the functionality of some browser extensions and websites.

The Authorization header value is cached by the browser and automatically sent with every request to the same domain. Because it accompanies each request, it can be used to identify and track you in much the same way as cookies.

## Browser API

![Browser API *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/windows/version_8/protection/browser_api.png)

### Block WebRTC

Blocks WebRTC, a known vulnerability that can leak your real IP address even if you use a proxy or VPN.

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that allows direct streaming of data between browsers and apps. It can let others know your true IP address, even if you use a proxy or VPN. Enabling this option can disrupt the work of certain browser applications, such as messengers, chats, cinemas, or games.

### Block Push API

The Push API allows servers to send messages to web applications regardless of the activity status of your browser. This is why you may receive notifications from websites even if your browser is hidden in the tray or not launched. Enabling this option completely blocks the Push API.

### Block Location API

When this option is enabled, the browser will no longer send GPS data to websites. This prevents them from determining your location, altering search results, or tailoring content based on where you are.

### Block Flash

The Flash Player plugin is outdated and highly vulnerable to viruses and exploits. It can also slow down website loading. Enabling this option prevents browsers from detecting Flash components (such as plugins or ActiveXObject objects), which effectively disables Flash support.

## Windows tracking

![Windows tracking *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/windows/version_8/protection/windows_tracking.png)

### Disable Windows telemetry

Disables sending technical data about your system and app usage.

### Turn off Advertising ID

Disables Advertising ID to block tracking of your app usage.

### Disable automatic reporting by Microsoft Defender

Blocks automatic reporting and sampling of suspected malware.

### Disable WAP Push message routing service

Disables data collection about Windows component problems

## Miscellaneous

![Miscellaneous *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/windows/version_8/protection/miscellaneous.png)

### Hide Referer from third parties

Referer is an HTTP header included in browser-to-server requests. It contains the URL of the request source. When you navigate from one page to another, Referer saves the URL of the initial page. The server that hosts the destination web page often has software that parses Referer and extracts various pieces of information from it.

Enabling the *Hide Referer from third-parties* option option prevents third-party websites from seeing this information by altering or removing the header.

You can also enter a custom value in the *Custom Referer* field. To use default Referer, leave the field blank.

Note that to be able to filter traffic, AdGuard applications 'intercept' browser-to-server requests. Requests to ad, tracking, and phishing servers may be altered before sending them to the server or blocked completely.

Same goes for the *Hide Referer from third parties* option: To filter traffic, AdGuard intercepts HTTP(S) requests and may alter or block them before they reach the server. The change happens only after the request leaves your browser. For this reason, if you check headers inside the browser (for example with Chrome Developer Tools), you will still see the original Referer. To confirm that it has been modified, you can use external tools such as Fiddler.

### Hide your User-Agent

When you visit a website, your browser sends a header called User-Agent as part of the HTTP request. It looks like a text line that begins with “User-Agent:”. This line usually contains details such as the browser name and version, operating system, and language settings.

By enabling this option, AdGuard removes identifying information from the User-Agent so advertisers and trackers cannot use it to profile you. If you prefer, you can enter a custom value in the Custom User-Agent field. To keep the default value, simply leave the field blank.

### Mask your IP address

AdGuard cannot completely hide your real IP address, but it can replace it with a different one so that websites interpret your connection as coming through a proxy. In some cases this helps to obscure your true IP.

You can enter any IP address you want to use in the corresponding field. To use the default IP address, leave the field blank.

### Remove X-Client-Data header

Prevents Google Chrome from sending information about its version and modifications in requests to Google domains, including services like DoubleClick and Google Analytics.

### Protect against DPI

The Deep Packet Inspection is a system of deep analysis and filtering of traffic by packet content, as well as the accumulation of statistical data. Using this technology, ISPs have the ability to control the passing traffic and limit access to content for their clients.

Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is a technology used by some ISPs to analyze and filter traffic based on packet content. It allows them to monitor connections, restrict access to certain resources, and collect statistics about users.

When this option is enabled, AdGuard modifies outgoing packet data so that it no longer matches the DPI blocking criteria. This can help you bypass restrictions and access the content you need. However, not all DPI systems can be circumvented yet — improvements are still in progress.

The *Protect from DPI* feature is already implemented in AdGuard for Windows, AdGuard for Mac, and AdGuard for Android.

:::caution

If this feature is enabled in AdGuard for Windows, it may interfere with ESET antivirus. In this case, ESET will not be able to filter traffic, leaving some malicious or blocked websites accessible.
