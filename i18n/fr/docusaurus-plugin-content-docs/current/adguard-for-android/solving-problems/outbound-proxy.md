This article explains how to set up some of the most popular proxies to work with AdGuard.

### How to use AdGuard with Tor

1. Open AdGuard and go to **Settings** > **Network** > **Proxy settings**. Download "Orbot: Proxy with Tor" by tapping **Integrate with Tor** or directly from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android&noprocess).

2. Open Orbot and press the **Start** button on the application's main screen.

2. Go back to the **Proxy Settings** screen of AdGuard.

3. Tap the **Integrate with Tor** button.

4. All the required fields will be pre-filled:

| Field      | Value                |
| ---------- | -------------------- |
| Proxy type | *SOCKS4* or *SOCKS5* |
| Proxy host | *127.0.0.1*          |
| Proxy port | *9050*               |

Or you can tap **Add proxy**, enter these values manually, and set Orbot as a default proxy.

5. Enable AdGuard protection.

> Now AdGuard will forward all traffic through Orbot. If you disable Orbot, Internet connection will be unavailable until you disable outbound proxy settings in AdGuard.

### How to use AdGuard with PIA (Private Internet Access)

*Here we presume that you are already a PIA VPN client and have it installed on your device.*

1. Open AdGuard and go to **Settings** > **Network** > **Proxy settings**.

Click the **Generate Password** button under the **Generate PPTP/L2TP/SOCKS Password** section. A username starting with "x" and a random password will be shown. Use them to fill out the **Username** and **Password** fields in AdGuard.

4. Set this proxy as a default one by toggling the switch, then click **Save**.

### How to use AdGuard with Shadowsocks

*Here we presume that you have already configured a Shadowsocks server and a client on your device.*

**Note: You should remove Shadowsocks application from filtering before setting up the process (AdGuard - Apps management - Shadowsocks - Disable AdGuard protection) to avoid infinite loops and drops.**

1. Open AdGuard and go to  **Settings** > **Network** > **Proxy settings**.

2. Tap the **Add proxy server** and fill the fields:

| Field      | Value       |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Proxy type | *SOCKS5*    |
| Proxy host | *127.0.0.1* |
| Proxy port | *1080*      |

3. Tap **Save and select**

### Limitations

There is a factor that can prevent certain traffic from being routed through the outgoing proxy. AdGuard will only re-route traffic that goes through it. Basically, it means apps that have **Ad blocking** flag enabled in the **Apps Management** tab.
