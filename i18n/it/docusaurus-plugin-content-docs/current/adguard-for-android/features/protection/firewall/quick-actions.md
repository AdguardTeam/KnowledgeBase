Quick actions can be found inside the _Firewall_ module, which can be accessed by tapping the _Protection_ tab (second-left icon at the bottom of the screen) and then selecting _Firewall_.

_Quick actions_ are based on the requests from _Recent activity_ (which can be found in [_Statistics_](/adguard-for-android/features/statistics)). This section shows which apps have recently connected to the Internet.

If you see an app that shouldn't be using the Internet at all or an app that you haven't used recently, you can block its access on the fly. This will not be possible unless the _Firewall_ module is turned on.
