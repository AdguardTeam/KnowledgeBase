If you're seeing annoying ads and popups in the bottom right corner of your screen, they're probably push notifications from your browser. While ad blockers can't stop them, you can easily disable them through your browser settings. Check out the step-by-step guide below to turn off these push notifications.

## In Google Chrome

1. Click the three vertical dots in the top right corner of the browser and select _Settings_.
2. Go to _Privacy and security_ → _Site settings_ → _Notifications_.
3. In _Default behaviour_, select _Don't allow sites to send notifications_. Alternatively, you can manage site-specific settings in _Customised behaviours_.

## In Firefox

1. Click the three horizontal lines in the top right corner of the navigation bar, then select _Settings_.
2. Select _Privacy & Security_ from the menu on the left.
3. Scroll down to the section _Permissions_, then click the button _Settings_ next to _Notifications_.
4. To stop notifications on all previously approved websites, click _Remove All Websites_. Alternatively, you can manage notifications for each website individually.
5. You can also select _Block new requests asking to allow notifications_ to stop all push notifications requests at once.
6. Click _Save Changes_.

## В Safari

1. Click _Safari_ in the menu bar → _System Settings_.
2. Go to the _Websites_ tab.
3. Select _Notifications_ from the left sidebar.
4. To block all requests, uncheck _Allow websites to ask for permission to send notifications_. Alternatively, select _Deny_ for each site you want to block individually.

## In Microsoft Edge

1. Click the three dots menu in the upper-right corner and select _Settings_.
2. In the left sidebar, click _Cookies and site permissions_.
3. Scroll down and click _Notifications_ under _Site permissions_.
4. Toggle off _Ask before sending_ to block all browser notifications within Microsoft Edge.
5. Alternatively, add domains to the _Block_ section for each site you want to block.

## Blocking push notifications with AdGuard

To avoid similar ads in the future, you can also block push notifications directly from the AdGuard apps.

2. Scroll down to the _Browser API_ section.
3. Enable _Block Push API_.

### On Mac
