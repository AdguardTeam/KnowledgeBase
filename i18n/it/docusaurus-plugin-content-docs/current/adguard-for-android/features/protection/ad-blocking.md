This article is about AdGuard for Android, a multifunctional ad blocker that protects your device at the system level. Per vedere come funziona, [scarica l'app di AdGuard](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

:::

The Ad blocking module can be accessed by tapping the _Protection_ tab (second-left icon at the bottom of the screen) and then selecting _Ad blocking_.

The feature blocks ads by applying ad-blocking and language-specific filters. To learn about the mechanism of ad blocking, you can read a [dedicated article](/general/ad-filtering/how-ad-blocking-works).

Basic protection effectively blocks ads on most websites. For more customized ad blocking, you can:

- Enable appropriate language-specific filters — they contain filtering rules for blocking ads on websites in specific languages

- Add websites to allowlist — these websites won't be filtered by AdGuard

- Create user rules — AdGuard will apply them on specified websites. [Learn how to create your own user rules](/general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters)
