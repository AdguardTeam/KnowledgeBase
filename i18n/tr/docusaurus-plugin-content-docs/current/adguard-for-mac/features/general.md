### Do not block search ads and website self-promoting ads

This feature prevents AdGuard from blocking [search ads and self-promotions on websites](/general/ad-filtering/search-ads). This can be useful, for example, when you’re shopping online and want to see discounts offered by some websites. Instead of adding these websites to the allowlist, you can exclude self-promotions and search ads from filtering.

### Activate language-specific filters automatically

This feature detects the language of the website you’re visiting and automatically activates appropriate filters for more accurate ad blocking. This is especially helpful if you change languages frequently.

### Başlangıçta AdGuard'ı başlat

This feature automatically launches AdGuard automatically after you restart your computer. This helps keep AdGuard protection active without having to manually open the app.

### Menü çubuğu simgesini gizle

This feature hides AdGuard’s icon from the menu bar but keeps AdGuard running in the background. If you want to disable AdGuard completely, click _Quit AdGuard_ in the main window menu.

### İzin listesi

Websites added to this list aren’t filtered. You can also access allowlisted websites from _User rules_.
