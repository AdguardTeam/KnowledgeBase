Our desktop apps, AdGuard for Windows and AdGuard for Mac, can be used as a proxy for other devices. This means that you can route other devices’ traffic through AdGuard (all traffic or traffic of specific apps and browsers).

:::note

These devices must be in the same network as the PC or Mac with AdGuard.

:::

HTTP traffic will be filtered in any case, but for AdGuard to be able to filter HTTPS traffic you need to manually install the AdGuard certificate on the connected device.

## How to download and install the certificate

Depending on the operating system of the device whose traffic you want to filter, follow one of these instructions:

### Windows {#windows}

1. Note the IP address of your desktop computer with AdGuard installed.

1. Make sure that AdGuard protection is enabled. On a Windows computer, check the box **Use AdGuard as an HTTP proxy** in the **Network** tab of its settings. For Mac, go to **Settings** → **Preferences** → **Network** and enable **HTTP proxy**.

1. On the same computer with AdGuard, follow this link: [http://local.adguard.org/cert](http://local.adguard.org/cert).

1. Click the **Download** button. If the download doesn’t start, try another browser, for example Firefox.

1. Transfer the downloaded **cert.cer** file to the Windows device whose traffic you want to route through AdGuard. You can use a USB cable, Bluetooth, or cloud services to do this.

1. On that device, press **Win**, type `Manage computer certificates` and press **Enter**.

1. On the *Certificates — Local Computer* page, find the *Trusted Root Certification Authorities* → *Certificates* folder.

1. Right-click the *Certificates* folder and click **All Tasks** → **Import**.

1. On the *Certificate Import Wizard* page, click **Next**.

1. Click **Browse** to import the certificate.

1. Navigate to the **cert.cer** certificate file, select it, click **Open**, then **Next**.

1. Select the **Place all certificates in the following store** checkbox.

1. Click **Save**.

### Mac {#mac}
