The purpose of _Tracking protection_ is to safeguard your sensitive personal data from online trackers and fraudsters. There are slight differences in the tracking protection features between Chromium-based browsers, which support MV3, and non-Chromium browsers, which support MV2.

_Tracking protection_ in non-Chromium browsers

_Tracking protection_ features prevent websites from seeing the search query you used to find them on the Internet, automatically delete third-party and website cookies, and more. A [separate article](/general/stealth-mode) is devoted to all these features.

:::note

Browser extensions are limited to a specific browser and are subject to its technical restrictions. Therefore, they cannot offer all the tracking protection features available in full-fledged ad-blocking apps.
