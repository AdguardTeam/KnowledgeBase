As any honest and well-performed effort should be rewarded, active translators on Crowdin can request a free AdGuard license key.

To request a **one-year** license key, you must translate at least 500 words in **previously untranslated** strings.

Just send us a request to [translate@adguard.com](mailto:translate@adguard.com) and you’ll get the license key as a token of our gratitude.

Besides, the most active translators may receive proofreader status in the future, should they express such an intention, and that promises even more good stuff.

Every year we present gifts with the AdGuard logo to our active proofreaders. If you want to become one of them, please write to [translate@adguard.com](mailto:translate@adguard.com).
