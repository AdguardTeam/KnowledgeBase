This article is about AdGuard for Mac, a multifunctional ad blocker that protects your device at the system level. To see how it works, [download the AdGuard app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

:::

During the installation of AdGuard on macOS High Sierra (or later), you may receive the message "System Extension Blocked". This is a new security mechanism introduced in High Sierra that requires you to explicitly allow the installation of a third-party system extension.

To complete the installation of AdGuard you have to manually allow loading the extension by clicking the "Allow" button in *System Preferences* → *Security & Privacy* → *General*.

On macOS Sequoia, you can do it in *System Preferences* → *Security & Privacy* → *General* → *Login Items & Extensions*. Once there, click the "i" icon next to *Network Extensions* and toggle the AdGuard option.

After that you will be able to proceed with the installation as usual.
