This article is about AdGuard for iOS, a multifunctional ad blocker that protects your device at the system level. Um zu sehen, wie es funktioniert, [laden Sie die AdGuard-App herunter](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

:::

In most cases, an ad blocker app and a VPN app cannot work together, due to certain system limitations.

Nevertheless, we've managed to find a solution to befriend [AdGuard VPN](https://adguard-vpn.com/) and AdGuard Ad Blocker.

On the _Protection_ section, you can easily switch between two apps.

### How to enable compatibility mode

**If you already have AdGuard Ad Blocker when installing AdGuard VPN, integrated (compatibility) mode will turn on automatically, allowing you to use our apps at the same time.**

If you have installed AdGuard VPN first and only then decided to try AdGuard Ad Blocker, follow these steps to use the two apps together:

1. Open AdGuard VPN for iOS app and select ⚙ _Settings_ in the lower right corner of the screen.
2. Go to _App settings_ and select _Operating mode_.
3. Switch the mode from VPN to Integrated.

:::note

In _Integrated mode_, AdGuard VPN's _Exclusions_ and _DNS server_ features are not available.
