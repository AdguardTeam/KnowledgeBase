> **Please note:** AdGuard is not an antivirus program. It can warn you when you're going to visit a malware or phishing website, but **it does not remove viruses from your device.**

If you suspect your computer is infected by malware or viruses, first of all you can inspect your computer with utilities from leading antiviruses.

**Free antivirus utilities**

There are many of them and you can use any one you prefer, for example:

[Dr.Web CureIt!](http://www.freedrweb.com/cureit/?lng=en)

If this check with antivirus utilities revealed nothing, but the computer still behaves suspiciously, try to test it for adware, which can implement its advertising on any pages that you open.

## How to clean your system from Adware {#adware}

On the Internet, you can find a lot of applications that are aimed at fighting this problem. You can use any utility you like. But we strongly recommend using **[AdwareCleaner](https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner)** by **Malwarebytes**. This application is quite easy to use and you will be able to handle it by yourself.

After the application has been downloaded and successfully installed, you should take the following steps:

1) Start the application and click **Scan now**.

3) When the items are moved to **Quarantine**, you will be able to **Clear the system** of unnecessary ballast.

4) In some cases, you may need to **Reboot the system** after cleaning is complete.

## How to recreate shortcuts for your browsers {#shortcuts}

Very often, malware and adware programs install their homepage in a very simple way — they substitute your browser's desktop shortcut, taskbar and *Start* menu items.

The simplest solution in this case is to manually delete all the shortcuts and recreate them by yourself.

### How to remove ads by BetterSurf {#bettersurf}

**What is BetterSurf?**

BetterSurf is an advertising program that builds itself into your browser. This program puts up its ads on all websites that you visit.

But with a keen eye you will be able to easily recognize these ads as ads that "weren’t here before". For example, it's extremely easy to notice them on websites like Facebook or Twitter.

To get rid of this program, use the [following instructions](http://malwaretips.com/blogs/bettersurf-virus-removal/).
