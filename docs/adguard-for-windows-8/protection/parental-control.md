There are several websites that children shouldn’t be able to access. *Parental control* helps you solve this problem.

When *Parental control* is enabled, AdGuard scans the content of webpages and blocks those that may be harmful or inappropriate for children. This includes adult images and text, crude language, violence, and drug-related content.

You can also turn on *Safe search* to remove inappropriate links from search results.

To prevent children from downloading unwanted programs, enable the *Block downloading exe.files* option. This option blocks them from downloading and installing software.

You can manage the *Blocklist* and the *Allowlist* to decide which websites should be blocked and which should be allowed.

Finally, you can protect these settings with a password and choose which user accounts they apply to.
