This article covers AdGuard for Windows, a multifunctional ad blocker that protects your device at the system level. To see how it works, [download the AdGuard app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

The _Network_ module is dedicated to network filtering, and here you will find additional network-related options. Two of them are enabled by default: _Enable traffic filtering_ and _Filter HTTPS_. These are important extra precautions to better filter your web space. Most websites are now using HTTPS, and the same applies to advertising. From many websites, like youtube.com, facebook.com, and x.com, it is impossible to remove ads without HTTPS filtering. So keep the _Filter HTTPS_ feature enabled unless you have a strong reason not to.

In this module you can select the checkbox _Use AdGuard as an HTTP proxy_ to use AdGuard as a regular HTTP proxy which will filter all traffic passing through it. You can also enable the _Filter websites with EV certificates_ feature. Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificates offer a stronger safety guarantee; owners of such websites have to pass a thorough and globally standardized identity verification process defined by EV guidelines. Which is the reason why some users trust websites with such certificates and prefer not to filter them.

At last, there is a section with proxy settings. There you can specify which proxy server AdGuard should use to update filters, get new versions, and so on.

### AdGuard VPN

The last section is dedicated to AdGuard VPN â€” an ideal tool that provides security and anonymity each time you browse the Internet. You can download it by clicking the _Download_ button or go to the AdGuard VPN website by clicking the _Homepage_ button.

How does AdGuard VPN work? Without going into technical details, we can say that VPN creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the user's computer or mobile device and a remote VPN server. In this way, data privacy is preserved, as well as the anonymity of the user, because a third-party observer sees the IP address of the VPN server and not the actual user's IP.

**What AdGuard VPN does:**

- hides your real whereabouts and helps you stay anonymous
- changes your IP address to protect your data from tracking
- encrypts your traffic to make it unreadable to third parties
- lets you configure where to use VPN and where not to (exclusions feature)
