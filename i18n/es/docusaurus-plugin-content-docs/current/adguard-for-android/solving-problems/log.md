### Collecting debug log

To collect **debug** log and send it to us you need to perform following steps:

1. Go to *Settings* → *General* → *Advanced*.
1. Tap *Logging level* and set it to *Debug*.
1. Reproduce the problem and try to remember the exact time it occurred.
1. Wait a while, then return to *Settings* and choose the *Support* tab. Tap *Report a bug* and complete the required fields. Don't forget to check the *Send app logs and system info* checkbox. Finally tap *Send*.

If you're interested in following the resolution of your issue and engaging in a dialogue with the developers, we recommend that you take the following steps after completing the first three:

1. Wait a while, then return to the *Advanced* screen and export logs via *Export logs and system info*. Then report a bug on GitHub by following these [instructions](/guides/report-bugs.md).
1. After creating an issue on GitHub, send the log file to devteam@adguard.com. Include the time of the bug and attach a link to your issue or its number (it appears as #number next to the title). Alternatively, you can upload the log file to Google Drive and send it to devteam@adguard.com. Add the file link to your GitHub issue
