The *Protection* tab contains all key security and filtering settings. Here you can control *Ad blocking*, *Tracking protection*, *Annoyance blocking*, *DNS filtering*, *Browsing security*, *Parental control*, and *Extensions*. You can also manage AdGuard Assistant here — a tool that lets you control its functionality without opening the app. Each of these features is described in a separate article.
