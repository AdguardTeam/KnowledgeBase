### 如何成为审核员 {#proofreaders}

We have proofreaders (previously known as moderators) for each language. And every active translator has an option to become one.

So, what are proofreaders responsible for?

**Proofreaders:**

- 审核并留下高质量的翻译，拒绝不好的翻译；

- 注意翻译的关联性；

- 参加注释中的讨论。

Every year, the best proofreaders receive gifts from AdGuard. Active translators do not go unrewarded either. Read more about our [reward system](../rewards).
