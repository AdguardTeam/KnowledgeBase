This article describes AdGuard for Windows v8.0, a comprehensive ad blocker that protects your device at the system level.

This is a beta version that is still under development. If you’d like to try it, download the [beta version of AdGuard for Windows v8](https://agrd.io/adguard_for_windows_8_beta).

The *Ad blocking* section is responsible for removing ads from the websites you visit and from the apps installed on your device. To filter banners, popups, trackers, and other intrusive elements, AdGuard relies on filters — sets of rules written in a [special syntax](/general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters). If you’d like to learn more about how they work, read our [article about filters](/general/ad-filtering/how-ad-blocking-works).

Here you can:

- enable basic protection,
- block [search ads and self-promotion](/general/ad-filtering/search-ads),
- disable ads in the Start menu on Windows 11,
- enable automatic activation of language-specific filters
- manage user rules.

You can also open the *Filtering log* to view all requests made by browsers and apps on your computer. From there, it’s easy to block or unblock any request by creating a custom rule. In the *Filter editor*, you can create, add, and import your own rules and filters.
