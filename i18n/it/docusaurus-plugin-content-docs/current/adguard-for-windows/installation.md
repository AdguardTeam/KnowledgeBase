### Advanced method {#advanced}

In case regular uninstall doesn't work for any reason, you can try to use an advanced method. First of all, you need to [download the uninstaller tool](https://cdn.adtidy.org/distr/windows/Uninstall_Utility.zip) created by our developers. Extract the archive to any folder on your PC and run the **Adguard.UninstallUtility.exe** file, and allow the app to make changes to your device. Then follow the instruction below:

- Select *AdGuard Ad Blocker* and *Standard* uninstall type, then click *Uninstall*.

![Standard uninstall *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/windows/installation/ab_standard.jpg)

- Click *OK* once the warning window pops up:

![Standard uninstall warning *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/windows/installation/ab_extended_warning.jpg)

- Wait until uninstall is finished — there will be a phrase **Uninstall complete** and a prompt to restart your computer:

![Uninstall finished *border](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/kb/ad_blocker/windows/installation/ab_standard_complete.jpg)

Follow the next steps only if performing the first two steps wasn’t enough for some reason. We strongly suggest contacting our support before using steps 3-4 of advanced uninstall instruction.

- Select *AdGuard Ad Blocker* and *Extended* uninstall type, then click *Uninstall*. Click *Yes, continue* in the window prompt.
