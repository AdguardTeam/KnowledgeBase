Apart from the large key modules of AdGuard Browser Extension, there are several more specific features that can be configured in the _General_ and _Additional settings_ tabs of the extension settings.

## General {#general}

In the _General_ tab, you can allow search ads and the [self-promotion of websites](/general/ad-filtering/search-ads), enable the automatic activation of language-specific filters, indicate the filters' update interval, etc.

Besides, here you can enable [_Phishing and malware protection_](/general/browsing-security).

You can save your settings configuration by clicking the _Export settings_ button. The settings will be saved as a .json file. To import the previously saved settings configuration, use the _Import settings_ function. You can even use it to quickly switch between different settings profiles or even to transfer settings configurations between different browsers.

## Additional settings {#misc}

The _Additional settings_ section contains a range of various settings that are related to the ad blocking process and application usability.

From this tab, you can activate optimized filters, enable notifications about extension updates, open the _Filtering log_, or clear the statistics of blocked ads and trackers.

Besides, you can opt to help us with the development of filters by sending the statistics on applied rules: which ones are triggered, on which websites, and how often. This option is disabled by default as we do not collect user data without consent. Yet, if you enable it, all data will be strictly anonymized.

## About {#about}

In the _About_ section, you can find info about the current version, links to the EULA and Privacy policy, and to the repository of the Browser extension on GitHub.
