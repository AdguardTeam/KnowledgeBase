The Filter editor is a tool that allows you to view and manage filters at the level of individual rules. Filters are combined into thematic categories: *Ad Blocking*, *Privacy*, *Language-specific* filters, *Custom*, and *Other*.

With the Filter editor, you can:

- See all the filters that are currently enabled

- Edit existing filtering rules, add your own custom rules, or import ready-to-use ones

The Filter editor is especially useful for advanced users who want to fine-tune ad blocking by precisely controlling what is blocked or allowed. If you’re not familiar with creating your own rules, there is an article to help you learn how to do this.
