If you like AdGuard and want to spread your impressions of the product(s) over the internet — in social media, personal blogs and/or on websites — then this article can be useful for you.

Once you share your experience online, send us a link to [pr@adguard.com](mailto:pr@adguard.com) and we'll thank you with a free license key. It does not really matter if your website's audience is ten people or a thousand, we respect every effort. The only note to keep in mind is that your review should be roughly about 300 to 500 words.

If you want to make a video or to do something else, let us know in advance, just to avoid misunderstandings in the future. The same applies if your plan includes the use of AdGuard logo, banners or other visual elements. The contact email remains the same: [pr@adguard.com](mailto:pr@adguard.com).
