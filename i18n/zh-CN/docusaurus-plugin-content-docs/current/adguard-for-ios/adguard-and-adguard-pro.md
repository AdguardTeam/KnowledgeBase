本文所述 AdGuard iOS 版是在系统级上保护设备的多功能的广告拦截器。 要了解其工作原理，请[下载 AdGuard 应用程序](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

If you look for AdGuard in the App Store, you'll find two apps — [AdGuard](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1047223162) and [AdGuard Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1126386264). These apps are designed to block ads and trackers in Safari, other browsers, and apps, and to manage DNS protection.

Don't be misled by their names, both apps block ads on smartphones and tablets by Apple. They used to differ in functionality due to the changing App Store review guidelines, but now these two apps are [basically the same](https://adguard.com/en/blog/updating-adguard-pro-for-ios.html).

If you have purchased AdGuard premium, there is no need to get AdGuard Pro, and vice versa.
