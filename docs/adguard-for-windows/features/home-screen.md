AdGuard for Windows is an easy-to-use tool that blocks annoying banners, popups, video ads, and trackers. But that's not all: it helps you save traffic, load web pages faster, and protect your computer from undesirable and potentially malicious websites. AdGuard also protects you from phishing websites and keeps your kids away from inappropriate content.

Once you start AdGuard for Windows, you will see the main screen of the app. Its most noticeable detail is the *enable/disable protection* button. Also, on this screen you can monitor blocked ads, trackers and threats statistics, find out the current version of the app or update it. Furthermore, there are four tabs in the upper right corner: *Settings*, *Support*, *License*, and *About*. Each of these is worth talking about separately.
