Starting with One UI 6.1.1 (Android 14), Samsung introduced a security enhancement called _Auto Blocker_, which is enabled by default on the latest Galaxy smartphones. This feature automatically blocks sideloaded apps from unverified sources unless the user manually overrides the setting.

Since AdGuard for Android [can’t be published on Google Play](https://adguard.com/en/blog/adguard-google-play-removal.html), you have to install it manually. However, with the new _Auto Blocker_ feature enabled, some users may experience problems when installing AdGuard APK files. To address this issue, we’ve provided a step-by-step guide on how to disable _Auto Blocker_ below.

## How to disable Auto Blocker

Follow the instructions to turn off _Auto Blocker_.

1. Open your device settings
2. Go to _Security and privacy_
3. Scroll down and select _Auto Blocker_
4. Toggle the setting off
