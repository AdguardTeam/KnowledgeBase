This article covers AdGuard for Mac, a multifunctional ad blocker that protects your device at the system level. To see how it works, [download the AdGuard app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

:::

AdGuard has a database of fraudulent, phishing, and malicious domains. If you enable *Phishing and malware protection*, AdGuard will warn you every time you’re about to visit a dangerous website. Even if only some parts of the website are dangerous, AdGuard will check it and display a warning.

This is safe. As AdGuard checks hash prefixes, not URLs, it doesn’t know what websites you visit. [Learn more about AdGuard’s security checks](/general/browsing-security)

:::note

AdGuard is not an antivirus software. It can’t stop you from downloading suspicious files or delete existing viruses.
