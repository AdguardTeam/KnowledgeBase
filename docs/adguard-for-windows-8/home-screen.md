This article describes the beta version of AdGuard for Windows v8.0, a comprehensive ad blocker that protects your device at the system level.

This is a beta release and still under development. If you’d like to try it, download the [beta version of AdGuard for Windows v8](https://agrd.io/adguard_for_windows_8_beta).

:::

When you open AdGuard for Windows v8.0, the first thing you’ll notice is the main screen. Its central element is the large switch that turns protection on and off.

Right above the switch are the icons for *Ad blocking*, *Tracking protection*, *DNS protection*, and *Annoyance blocking*. You can activate any of them with a single click.

If you want to fine-tune the app, open the menu on the left. To set up ad blocking and security features manually, go to the *Protection* tab.

In *Statistics*, you can see how many ads, trackers, and threats have been blocked.

*App management* gives you control over filtering and routing for installed apps.

Finally, the *Settings* tab contains your license details, general preferences like language and theme, and additional network or advanced settings for experienced users.

Each of these is worth talking about separately.
