This article is about the AdGuard Browser Extension, which safeguards only your browser. To protect your entire device, [download the AdGuard app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

:::

[AdGuard Browser Extension](https://adguard.com/adguard-browser-extension/overview.html) is a free extension that works in five popular browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, and Yandex Browser. You can easily find it in your browser’s online store or on our official website.

Browser extensions include basic ad-blocking features but cannot be compared with full-featured desktop programs, such as [AdGuard for Windows](/adguard-for-windows/features/home-screen) and [AdGuard for Mac](/adguard-for-mac/features/main).

:::note

We have a standalone extension for Safari. Since the release of [Safari 13](https://adguard.com/en/blog/adguard-safari-1-5.html), most of the ad-blocking extensions have experienced huge issues and many of them stopped functioning. We had to develop a [separate extension for Safari](/adguard-for-safari/features/general) that has some differences in comparison with the extension described in this article.

**Do not forget that the functionality of each extension is strictly limited by the browser’s capabilities.** So if you want to get full-fledged protection, consider installing a standalone program for your computer. There's [a reason why](adguard-browser-extension/comparison-standalone).
