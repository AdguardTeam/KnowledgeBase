The _Protection_ tab contains all key security and filtering settings. Here you can control _Ad blocking_, _Tracking protection_, _Annoyance blocking_, _DNS protection_, _Browsing security_, _Parental control_, and _Extensions_. You can also manage AdGuard Assistant here — a tool that lets you control its functionality without opening the app. Each of these features is described in a separate article.
