There are two options to activate premium features on AdGuard for iOS app:

1) Purchase a subscription. Just tap on the **Get Premium** plaque anywhere in the app and follow the on-screen instructions. All you'll need to do is enter your Apple ID password and confirm the purchase. You can choose between a monthly, yearly and lifetime subscriptions.

2) Use an AdGuard license (you can purchase it at [AdGuard website](https://adguard.com/en/license.html)). Log into your AdGuard personal account via the app: go to *AdGuard app > Settings > License* screen and tap on the **Login** button there. You'll be asked to enter your AdGuard Personal account credentials*. After you do, if you have any valid license key in your account, it will be automatically picked up to activate Premium in your AdGuard for iOS app.

> As an alternative, you can just enter a valid license key in the e-mail field leaving password field blank to activate Premium features.

> PS: AdGuard Pro for iOS (our other iOS app) can only be purchased from [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/adguard-pro-adblock-privacy/id1126386264).
