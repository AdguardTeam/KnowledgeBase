This article is about AdGuard for Android, a multifunctional ad blocker that protects your device at the system level. To see how it works, [download the AdGuard app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

:::

In an effort to improve user privacy, Google has expanded the restriction settings in Android 15. More settings, such as *App usage access*, now require an additional permission to be enabled. Since the *[Firewall](/adguard-for-android/features/protection/firewall)* and *[Detect Samsung Pay](/adguard-for-android/solving-problems/samsungpay-with-adguard-in-south-korea)* features require the *App usage access* setting to be enabled for them to work properly, you may have experienced problems using them. To resolve these issues, please follow the steps below.

:::note

AdGuard has a strict no-logging policy, which means that we do not collect your data or send it to third parties. We only ask for access to data without which the application cannot function.
