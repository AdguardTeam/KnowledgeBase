There are several websites that children shouldn’t be able to access. _Parental control_ helps you solve this problem.

When _Parental control_ is enabled, AdGuard scans the content of webpages and blocks those that may be harmful or inappropriate for children. This includes adult images and text, crude language, violence, and drug-related content.

You can also turn on _Safe search_ to remove inappropriate links from search results.

To prevent children from downloading unwanted programs, enable the _Block downloading exe.files_ option. This option blocks them from downloading and installing software.

You can manage the _Blocklist_ and the _Allowlist_ to decide which websites should be blocked and which should be allowed.

Finally, you can protect these settings with a password and choose which user accounts they apply to.
