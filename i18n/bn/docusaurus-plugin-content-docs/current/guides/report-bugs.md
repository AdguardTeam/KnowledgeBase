If you notice a bug while using AdGuard products, please help us address it. Here’s how to report bugs most effectively.

## Before you start

### When to report bugs

Check that you have the most up-to-date version, and if not, upgrade: the bug might have already been resolved in the new version.

Check if the bug hasn’t been reported before. We advise paying attention to both open and closed issues.

### How to describe a problem

Try to provide as many details as possible — that'll make it easier for us to reproduce the bug and figure out how to fix it. Here’s what we expect a bug report to include:

- Your app version
- Your OS version
- When you noticed the problem
- What you were doing or what happened to the app before you noticed the problem. Steps to reproduce it
- Whether it recurred and with what frequency
- Whether you have a VPN or an antivirus software

### How to collect logs

Read about collecting logs in dedicated articles for each platform.

## How to vote for bug reports or feature requests

If you want to support the implementation of a new feature or bugfix, you can vote for it on GitHub. To vote, just react with some emoji.
