Sometimes in order to understand a problem and fix it we need to collect **log files**, or **logs**. Basically, these files contain information about the program and it's work.

#### Collecting debug log

To collect **debug** log and send it to us you need to perform following steps:

1. Open AdGuard and go to "Settings".

2. Choose "Advanced".

3. Set "Logging level" to "Record everything". It's desirable to close all background apps that don't concern the problem beforehand.

4. Reproduce the problem and set the logging level back to "Default". Notice the exact time when it happened.

5. Send us a message from program by choosing "Support" > "Send Feedback" in the menu. Don't forget to check the "Send detailed system info" checkbox under the text field and to include the timestamp from the step 4 into the message.

As an alternative, you can export the logs (along with the *state.txt* file that contains system information and information about AdGuard settings) directly into a local file. It can be convenient, for example, if you are having a conversation with a developer on [GitHub](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues), [forum](https://forum.adguard.com/) or on another platform.

To export logs and system information into a file, go to "Settings — Advanced" and tap "Export logs and system info". Select the destination folder and tap "Save".

#### Collecting web requests log

To collect **web requests** log and send it to us you need to perform following steps:

1. Open AdGuard and go to "Settings".

2. Choose "Advanced".

3. Set "Logging level" to "Record web requests". It's desirable to close all background apps that don't concern the problem beforehand.

4. Reproduce the problem and set the logging level back to "Default". Notice the exact time when it happened.

5. Send us a message from program by choosing “Support” > "Send Feedback" in the menu. Don't forget to check the "Send detailed system info" checkbox under the text field and to include the timestamp from the step 4 into the message.
