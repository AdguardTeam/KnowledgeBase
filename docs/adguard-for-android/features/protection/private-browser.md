This article is about AdGuard for Android, a multifunctional ad blocker that protects your device at the system level. To see how it works, [download the AdGuard app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

:::

In v4.7, AdGuard for Android introduced an in-app private browser. You can access it from the main screen by tapping the *Private browser* button or from the *Protection* tab, where you can find some customization options.

Here's what you can set up:

- To set a default search engine, tap *Default search engine* and choose between the available options: DuckDuckGo (default), Google, Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, or Yandex
- To create a browser shortcut, tap *Create browser widget* and follow the on-screen instructions
- To get suggestions from your search engine instead of typing the entire query, toggle the *Search suggestions* option

:::note

The private browser is still in the early stages of development and has some limitations. For now, we recommend using it as a supplement to your browserâ€™s Incognito mode, rather than as a replacement.
