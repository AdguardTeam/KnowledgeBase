거의 모든 주요 플랫폼을 위한 AdGuard 앱이 있으며, 모든 플랫폼에 대한 업데이트를 정기적으로 출시합니다. This would not be possible without beta and nightly testing and, more importantly, without our testers. Want to become one of them? Here’s how you can do it.

### Beta or nightly: what is the difference?

Both beta and nightly testing are important to make AdGuard constantly better. However, they are different, and you can choose the one that suits you more.

The development process follows a progression from nightly to beta and then from beta to the final, stable version — release. It means that you are more likely to find bugs in nightly builds, but you get access to new features faster, almost on a daily basis. Betas are more stable, but you will get updates less often.

## How to become a beta or nightly tester {#intro}

Our requirements are easy: use AdGuard, upgrade to the beta/nightly version when it becomes available, and report any bugs you notice. You will need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to become our tester, so you may want to get that out of the way first.

You will also need the device on which you will install the app and [the link to the the beta testing page](https://adguard.com/beta.html). There you will find more information on how to join our program and test AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS.

If you want to skip the description part and get straight to the action, you can apply [here](https://surveys.adguard.com/beta_testing_program/form.html). Your application will be reviewed within 1-3 working days, and you'll get a reply via email.

:::note

To get the AdGuard for iOS beta or nightly build, first you have to install [Testflight](https://apps.apple.com/app/testflight/id899247664) on your iOS device.

## 버그를 신고하는 방법 {#report-a-bug}

If you spotted a bug or just want to share your suggestion, let us know: go to [GitHub](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/), find a suitable repository, create a new issue there, and describe the bug/feature request in detail.

The above method is the most preferred, but you can use others if necessary:

- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AdguardEn/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adguard/) 등 다양한 소셜 미디어 플랫폼에서 저희를 만나보세요. 하지만 이는 기술적인 문제를 논의하는 데 가장 편리한 방법은 아닙니다.

- 앱의 지원 탭에서 저희의 지원 팀에게 이메일을 보내거나, [support@adguard.com](mailto:support@adguard.com)으로 직접 보내주세요.

## How to activate a beta/nightly key in the iOS app {#ios}

If you have already received a beta key and it is listed in your `adguard.com` account, go to the app and open the license section (Get Premium). Once there, enter the credentials from your AdGuard account. After that, the premium features will become available automatically.

### What else?

There is not much more to add. You don't have to go out of your way to find bugs. You can continue using AdGuard as usual. However, if you encounter a bug, please report it. Of course, we appreciate any additional effort.

Occasionally, you will receive our newsletters, keeping you informed of the latest changes in the beta (in case you missed them) and other important news. You can unsubscribe from it at any time.
