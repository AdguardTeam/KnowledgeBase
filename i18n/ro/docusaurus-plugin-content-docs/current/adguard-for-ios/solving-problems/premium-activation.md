Acest articol se referă la AdGuard pentru iOS, un blocant de reclame multifuncțional care vă protejează dispozitivul la nivel de sistem. To see how it works, [download the AdGuard app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock).

There are two ways to activate Premium features in the AdGuard for iOS app:

1. **Buy a subscription through the App Store** — monthly, yearly, or lifetime. You can subscribe by tapping the *Premium* label anywhere in the app or from the *License* tab. A 7-day free trial is available for new users.

2. **Buy an AdGuard license on our [website](https://adguard.com/license.html).** To activate it, open your AdGuard app, tap *Settings → License → Log in*, and enter the same email address you used for the purchase. You can also enter the activation code in the email field and leave the password field blank. However, we recommend using the email and password combination because it is a more secure option.

:::note

AdGuard Pro for iOS is our other iOS app. It can only be purchased from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/adguard-pro-adblock-privacy/id1126386264).
