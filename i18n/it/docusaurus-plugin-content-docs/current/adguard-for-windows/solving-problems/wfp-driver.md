Questo articolo riguarda AdGuard per Windows, un blocco annunci multifunzionale che protegge il tuo dispositivo a livello di sistema. To see how it works, [download the AdGuard app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

To filter network traffic, AdGuard uses a network driver. There are two options: TDI driver and WFP driver. While WFP driver is generally preferrable and is enabled by default for all newer Windows OS versions (Windows 8 and newer), it can potentially cause compatibility problems, especially with some antiviruses. These problems and subsequent errors can be very different in each case.

If you encounter a problem that you suspect might be caused by this, you can always switch to the older but more stable TDI network driver. Per farlo:

1. Go to *Settings → Network*.

2. Disable WFP driver as it’s done in this picture:
