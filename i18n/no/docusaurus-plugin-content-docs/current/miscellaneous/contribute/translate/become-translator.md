### How to become a proofreader {#proofreaders}

We have proofreaders (previously known as moderators) for each language. And every active translator has an option to become one.

So, what are proofreaders responsible for?

**Proofreaders:**

- Approve high-quality translations and disapprove the bad ones;

- Look after the relevance of translations;

- Respond to comments related to translations in their language.

Every year, the best proofreaders receive gifts from AdGuard. Active translators do not go unrewarded either. Read more about our [reward system](../rewards).
