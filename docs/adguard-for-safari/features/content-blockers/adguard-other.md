*AdGuard Other* contains filters with various functions. For example, it has a filter that unblocks search ads and self-promo ads. In some cases, it helps find exactly what you are looking for, because these kinds of ads are more relevant and less intrusive than others.

:::note Disclaimer

We don’t have any ‘acceptable ads’ paid by advertisers. Instead, we provide users with an option to see [search ads and websites' self-promotion](/general/ad-filtering/search-ads).
