This article describes the beta version of AdGuard for Windows v8.0, a comprehensive ad blocker that protects your device at the system level.

This is a beta release and still under development. If you’d like to try it, download the [beta version of AdGuard for Windows v8](https://agrd.io/adguard_for_windows_8_beta).

The *Ad blocking* section is responsible for removing ads from the websites you visit and from the apps installed on your device. To filter banners, pop-ups, trackers, and other intrusive elements, AdGuard relies on filters — sets of rules written in a [special syntax](/general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters). If you’d like to learn more about how they work, read our [article about filters](/general/ad-filtering/how-ad-blocking-works).

Here you can:

- enable basic protection,
- block [search ads and self-promotion](/general/ad-filtering/search-ads),
- disable ads in the Start menu on Windows 11,
- enable automatic activation of language-specific filters
- manage User rules.

You can also open the *Filtering log* to view all requests made by browsers and apps on your computer. From there, it’s easy to block or unblock any request by creating a custom rule. In the *Filter editor* you can create, add, and import your own rules and filters.
