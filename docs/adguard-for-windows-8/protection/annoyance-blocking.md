Annoyance filters are designed to improve website usability by blocking non-advertisement elements that distract from or interfere with site interaction or content consumption. These elements include modal windows, interactive forms, cookie consent notifications and requests, mobile app banners, and various widgets.

These filters may contain rules that are not suitable for all users. Sometimes it is recommended to disable them. The decisions to add rules to this filter are made by filter developers on a rule-by-rule basis.
