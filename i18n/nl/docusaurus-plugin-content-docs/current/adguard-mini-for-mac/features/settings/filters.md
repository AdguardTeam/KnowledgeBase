In _Settings_ → _Filters_, you can enable separate filters or whole categories of filters.

Filters are the backbone of ad blocking and basically it’s what keeps the Internet clean. A filter is a list of rules written in a special syntax. Following these rules, content blockers can filter web traffic: block ads or requests to malicious websites.

Filters are combined into eight thematic categories: _Ad Blocking, Privacy, Social widgets, Annoyances, Security, Language-specific filters, Custom,_ and _Other filters_.

Changes in _Filters_ are also reflected in _Settings_ → _Safari extensions_.

## Custom filters

To add a custom filter, go to _Settings_ → _Filters_ → _Custom filters_ and enter a URL or a local file path in the relevant field.

You can find a lot of filters at [filterlists.com](https://filterlists.com/).
