This article is about AdGuard for Android, a multifunctional ad blocker that protects your device at the system level. To see how it works, [download the AdGuard app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

The Firewall module can be accessed by tapping the _Protection_ tab (second-left icon at the bottom of the screen) and then selecting _Firewall_.

This feature helps manage Internet access for specific apps installed on your device and for the device in general.

### Global firewall rules

This section allows you to control Internet access for the entire device.

These rules apply to all apps on your device unless you've set custom rules for them.

### Custom firewall rules

In this section, you can control Internet access for specific apps — restrict permissions for those that you don’t find trustworthy, or, on the contrary, unblock the ones you want to circumvent the global firewall rules.

1. Open _Custom firewall rules_. Under _Apps with custom rules_, tap _Add app_.

2. Select the app for which you want to set individual rules.

3. In _Available custom rules_, select the ones you want to configure and tap the “+” icon. The rules will now appear in _Applied custom rules_.

4. If you need to block a specific type of connection, toggle the switch to the left. If you want to allow it, leave the switch enabled. **Custom rules override global ones**: any changes you make in _Global firewall rules_ will not affect this app.

To delete a rule or app from _Custom rules_, swipe it to the left.

### Notifications

If enabled, this feature notifies you when an app is attempting to violate an applicable firewall rule, e.g. attempts to access mobile data from which it is blocked. You can turn notifications on and off for all apps or for each app separately.

Tap the notification to access the app’s Firewall settings, or temporary disable all Firewall rules for that app by tapping the corresponding button in the notification. You can also mute all Firewall notifications for the app by tapping the _Mute_ button in the notification for that app.

Note that if notifications for multiple apps would be displayed, they will be bundled into a single notification instead.
