As any honest and well-performed effort should be rewarded, active translators on Crowdin can request a free AdGuard license key and a VPN subscription.

To request a **one-year AdGuard license key** or a **one-year AdGuard VPN subscription**, you must translate at least **500** and **2,500** words respectively.

**Here’s how our reward system works**

```
For the first one-year AdGuard license, you need to translate 500 words.
For the second license, you need 1000 words, i.e. 1500 words altogether.
All subsequent licenses require an additional 1500 words per license.

For the first one-year AdGuard VPN subscription, you need to translate 2,500 words.
All subsequent subscriptions or renewals require an additional 2,500 words per subscription.

```
Just send us a request to [translate@adguard.com](mailto:translate@adguard.com) and you’ll get the license as a token of our gratitude.

Besides, the most active translators may receive proofreader status in the future, should they express such an intention, and that promises even more good stuff.

Every year we present gifts with the AdGuard logo to our active proofreaders. If you want to become one of them, please write to [translate@adguard.com](mailto:translate@adguard.com).
