This article is about AdGuard for Mac, a multifunctional ad blocker that protects your device at the system level. To see how it works, [download the AdGuard app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)

:::

If you have Content Restrictions enabled on your Mac, AdGuard will stop web pages from loading. To check if Content Restrictions are active:

1. Go to System Settings → Screen Time → Content & Privacy → Content Restrictions

1. Check if the setting for Access to Web Content is set to *Limit Adult Websites*

If this setting is on, pages won’t load. To continue using AdGuard, disable Content & Privacy in Screen Time, and then restart the system.
